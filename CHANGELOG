0.8.30

 [.3]
  + Added D3D11 Graphics Pipeline Widget, it displays most of the important stats from the
      shader analytics feature (Ctrl + Shift + R) over a 5 to 10-second history.
  + Added D3D11 SwapChain Menu, I'll fill the stuff in with tooltips later.
   >> This mostly benefits Windows 10 users
  + Fixed Trails of Cold Steel Alt+F4 behavior so it no longer exits if you're trying to
      close a different program
  + Added 1 frame swapchain latency in Flip Mode to ensure G-Sync doesn't destroy timing :)
   >> Will make this an option and restore the original latency reducing measures for
        non-G-Sync users in a future update.

 [.2]
  + Added CPU Monitor as an official widget, with OSD config and all
  + Added grid rulers for docked widgets while moving them
  + Added option to disable resizing widgets
  + Added persistent storage of widget positions
  + Added user-defined min/max size constraints to widgets
  + Fixed keybind parsing problems with numpad and Left/Right Alt keys

 [.1]
  + Fixed D3D8 / DDraw Wrapping

 + Added persistent config to some of the widgets (Volume Control / GPU Stats / Framepacing)
  >> Right click those widgets to open a config menu for them
 + Fixed DDRAW / D3D8 wrapper problems
 + Corrected scaling on menus

0.8.29

 + The peak volume meter is now a histogram, assigned color based on channel
 + Peak volume moves left / right depending on channel
 + Added very early GPU hardware stat graphs to a new GPU widget
 + Mouse cursor and input behavior when interacting with widgets is more intuitive
  >> You can even move them around without the config menu open
 + Fixed Dark Souls 3 Texture Cache reference leaks
 + Disabled a few of the optimizations from 0.8.28 for compatibility with GeForce Experience
  >> Will investigate further in the future

0.8.28

 + Removed tooltips from graph data views
 + Fixed G-Sync status query in D3D9 games
 + Added minimum flush interval for log I/O (100 ms default)
 + Coalesced all INI file output into a single buffered write for improved
     disk I/O performance
 + Restored multi-threaded DLL analysis at startup (performance)

0.8.27

 + Added OSD Widgets (framepacing and CPU load)
  >> Will polish these off later, they're just toys for now.
 + Changed Special K's config menu to work similar to a Mac, for easier access
     to the branches sub-menu at lower resolutions
 + Fixed various Windows 7 issues

0.8.26

 + Added G-Sync status to framerate readout on OSD
 + Cleaned up log formatting, turn wordwrap off to appreciate the changes ;)
 + Various DLL Loader compliance issues have been fixed (in third-party software),
     including using incorrect paths, wrong flags, etc.
   >> I am likely to encounter broken software that relied on the original undefined
        behavior, I'll fix it when it causes problems :)
   >> This change actuall solves a few oddball problems in the meantime
 + Added mouse warp deadzone configuration to the control panel for games with obnoxious
     mouselook.
 + Fixed occasional Wbem Locator issues caused by the Steam Overlay
   >> The reason that CPU stats, etc. can take several seconds to load is because the Steam 
        overlay holds a thread sync lock on the service needed for those stats. The reason
          those stats sometimes crash games is ... because the Steam overlay holds a lock.
   >> Tsk, tsk, Steam - other people need those services too, damit :)

0.8.25:

 + Fixed mouse input in Mouse Effect: Andromeda, *AGAIN*.
 + Officially supports dinput8.dll injection; the compatibility menu does not offer this
     as one of its choices, but it will eventually.
  >> dinput8.dll, for games that use this, has the greatest chance of working with fullscreen
       video capture software.
 + Improved keyboard input processing, particularly how it behves while in Input Exclusive mode
     and you trigger the keybinding to toggle the config menu.
  >> This is preparing for customizable keybindings, I've been promising them for a long time :)
 + Fixed occasional right-to-left window orientation problems in 64-bit builds
 + Fixed D3D11 reference counting underflows in some games, especially when a third-party
     render enhancing mod is present.

     because a graphics engine has altered them.

0.8.24.4:

 + Fix deadlock caused by MSI Nahimic due to hotpatching 32-bit code
  >> Add MORE padding bytes than the x86 ABI requires because Nahimic is borked

 + Fixed all known multi-threaded rendering problems (Dishonored2 can be debugged now).
 + Reduced texture cache overhead
 + Improved WMI monitoring performance

 + Added module name and fixed newline endings in game_output.log

0.8.22:

 + [Misc]  Stopping injection while programs are using Special K no longer crashes them :)

 + [D3D11] Added option to enable staging texture cache (for Unity games)
 + [SKIM]  Added option to start SKIM automatically during install and to system tray
 + [SKIM]  Added list of (64-bit) programs currently injected and a confirmation if you
             attempt to stop injection while a program is using Special K.
 + [SKIM]  Added tooltip to system tray icon
 + [D3D11] Added support for changing fullscreen display scaling mode while your game is
             running; should make using centered scaling modes a bit more intuitive.
 + [Misc]  Added injection stats to Help menu, mouseover Global Injector version to see
             basic information about games recently played.

0.8.21:

 + [SKIM]   Changed system tray icon (to another KDE icon =P) so that it is easier to
              recognize
 + [XInput] Fix for games that use XInputGetStateEx (...) without allocating the correct
              memory size for the data structure (+1 DWORD)
 + [D3D11]  Reduced D3D11 API overhead in games that stream memory-mapped textures when
              texture caching is enabled but the render mod window is not open
 + [SKIM]   Using +Inject or -Inject commandline switches starts SKIM minimized to the
              tray; left-click the icon in the try to restore it
 + [SKIM]   Branch migration takes effect immediately in all software except for the
              global injector
 + [SKIM]   Only one instance of SKIM can run simultaneously, minimized instances will
              be restored if a new instance is launched
 + [SKIM]   The commandline switch -Inject will now kill any running injection instances
              and exit

             texture mod tools.

 + [D3D11] Improved multi-threaded safety in the D3D11 mod tools for games that draw
             from multiple threads.
 + [SKIM]  Added support to minimize SKIM v 0.7.0+ to the System Tray and have it
             manage global injection for the end-user.

0.8.18:

0.8.17:

 + Added Last-Known-RenderAPI to Special K's INI file to help with the auto-detect
     mechanism on the compatibility menu
 + Corrected scenario where having a local API wrapper version of Special K in-place
     and one of the API virtual files (i.e. SpecialK.d3d9) would cause both DLLs to
       load.
 + Temporarily re-enabled auto-update.

0.8.16:

     (refer to Display.Output)

     (ImGui changed to use hooked D3D11 functions instead of trampoline)
 + Added support for resolutions as low as 1280x720 and 1024x768

     problems when the CBT hook inevitably tries to re-inject the DLL.

0.8.12:

 + Removed legacy command console code (low-level keyboard hook, message pump)
