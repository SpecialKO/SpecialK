0.8.50
 
 + Made ReShade Shim Loading a bit more sane

  >> (d3d11, d3d9 and GL DLLs are dynamically generated on first load)

 + Added D3D11 Texture Reload Support


0.8.49

 (.2): Fixes startup issues in Elex

 (.1): Performance optimization for heavily multi-threaded engines that
         map and unmap D3D11 memory from different threads.

+ Added global injection whitelist using Regular Expression syntax.

  Manually create Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Global\whitelist.ini and enter
    patterns to match, one per line.

   >> Implicitly, the whitelist already contains this pattern:

        "SteamApps\\common\\" , which is part of the executable path for all
                                  Steam games.

  *** Restart global injection using SKIM64 any time you change the whitelist;
        it is only parsed at startup. ***

+ Locally wrapped games can now load ReShade from a central location by using a new
    shim loader DLL (ReShade32.dll / ReShade64.dll).
+ Eliminates D3D11 shaders generated by ReShade from the shader list
   >> That used to be a good way to crash the game ;)


0.8.48

 + Fixed incorrect alt+tab operation in fullscreen exclusive w/ window centering on
 + Eliminated D3D11 reference counting issues at startup
 + Improved window management reliability
 + Disabled cursor restriction while dragging windows
 + Added support for evaluating commands in parallel on deferred render contexts
     before they are coallesced by a (working) graphics driver.
   >> Fixes problems in Blue Reflection, though probably hurts performance.


0.8.47.2/3

 + Added rescale-to-fit behavior to Live Render Target and Texture View (D3D11)
 + Added support for DisableIfTexture predicate to d3d11_shaders.ini

  >> Right click a shader to access this menu (generally pixel shaders only)

0.8.47.1

 + Added per-tracked shader wireframe/on-top state and cleaned up D3D11 shader UI

  >> Default is now to draw the tracked shader on-top

0.8.47

 + Added support for D3D11 Shader state load/store (d3d11_shaders.ini)

      (Refer to the new button pannel in the Shader Mod Tools)

  >> Will add annotations for hash names to something more meaningful later
  >> Will also add ability to save shader profiles in order to enable/disable
       known effects.
  >> Command console will also allow loading profiles by name and manipulating
       the stored shader values, so that you can macro this stuff to keybinds.

 + Added sRGB -> UNORM override if Flip Model is enabled in D3D11 games, this
     allows G-Sync in Unity games

 + Added FlipEx mode to D3D9Ex override, allowing G-Sync in windowed mode in D3D9


0.8.46

 + Local Wrapper DLLs no longer use AppCache for config
 + Fix for Steam games with Trademark symbols in their name when using the
     global injector config repository... you may need to clear Special K's
       AppCache directory before this takes affect.
 + Corrected attempts to auto-detect D3D8 / DDraw as the primary graphics API
     when the required dgVoodoo API support plug-in is not present
 + D3D11 Texture injection optimizations
 + Disabled Sleepless Render Thread by default for improved compatibility


0.8.45

 + Improved vertex memory alignment in ImGui D3D9 renderer
 + Fixed memory alignment issues for non-standard packed DXTn textures (D3D9)
 + Fixed Agarest Zero / 2 D3D9 texture management
 + Exit Confirmation Dialog now focuses on the Cancel button using gamepad input
 + Thread optimizations for D3D9/11 texture injection


0.8.44

 + Added Denuvo activation management to all Denuvo-based (STEAM games)

  >> I am not a fan of Origin, maybe if they publish more games I like and open up their
       platform's API a littlebit I will give Origin+Denuvo the same features? :)

 + Corrected formatting on the D3D9 framebuffer tooltip

  >> Mouseover the resolution number in a D3D9 game for Special K's "stats for Nerds" :P

 + Added support for games that use the very latest version of SteamAPI (mostly VR nonsense)
 + Improved performance in games that busy-wait using PeekMessage (...)  (i.e. Sonic Mania)
 + Minor correction for some D3D9 games having issues with texture modding


0.8.43

 + Enabled triple-buffering override in D3D11 fullscreen (non-flip-model) mode
 + Disabled non-mipmapped texture cache in Divinity: Original Sin 2

  >> If you want to mod its UI textures, turn this option back on and turn staging texture
       uploads on. This is under the D3D11 / Texture Management settings.

 + Improved multi-threaded texture cache performance for games like Divinity: Original Sin 2
 + Removed username from file paths in logs
 + Add SteamAPI offline check bypass option


0.8.42

 + Last update prior to hurricane Irma
 + Improved D3D9 texture injection performance


0.8.41

 + Improved support for D3D9 texture modding, and made it an opt-in thing since it's still
     experimental.
 + Added File | Exit to the control panel


0.8.40

 + Added somewhat functional texture modding support to D3D9
  >> Will finish at a later date

 + Integrated UI memory management fixes for FFXIII
 + Improved thread-safety in D3D9 shader mod tools
 + Added scaling option to widgets (needs a ton of work)
 + Added clothing preferences to Gal*Gun: Double Peace


0.8.38

 + Integrates about 33 - 50% of Tales of Berseria Fix's shader modding functionality
 + Fixes SteamAPI problems in older games


0.8.37

 + Preliminary support for a native Steam Controller input backend
  >> Does not utilize any of the special features, merely blocks native SteamAPI input
       while the config UI is open
  >> Generally for the 1% of games that use native Steam, this requires Special K to be
       installed as a local wrapper because it needs to catch SteamAPI initialization early.


0.8.36

 + Performance-tuned memory pattern scanner to offer alignment and address above/below
     search heuristics.

   >> Significantly speeds up repeating pattern searches (i.e. hard-coded resolutions)

 + Added Resolution Override to Gal Gun and Akiba's Trip

  >> This is different from the way this feature normally works, it goes beyond API
       reflection/introspection and instead patches certain hardcoded arrays of memory
         in really crappy JRPG ports.

 + Added D3D11 Wireframe Mode (per-shader)
 + Added additional D3D11 Shader Culling options (per-Shader Resource View)
 + Added support for BC7 and BC6H textures to Final Fantasy X/X-2
 + Fixed Shader Resource View formats for injected D3D11 textures using alternate formats
 + Fixed Global Injection Blacklist issues
 + Turned off all widgets by default for new installs

0.8.34.1

 + Fixed SteamAPI problem in Dark Souls III
 + Added Browse ReShade Assets to File Menu
 + Improved ReShade stats screen
 + Improved controller support in ReShade's UI
 + ReShade game presets are now stored in Profiles\<appname>\ReShade\<executable.ini>

0.8.34

 + Framerate limiter defaults to busy-wait again
  * The customization you do to the non-busy-wait method (under Advanced) are not saved
      when you exit a game.

 Added Support for Custom ReShade
 ================================
  + This release comes bundled with a test version of unofficial ReShade 3.0.666 ;)
  + The custom version goes in PlugIns/Unofficial, and you should place the official
      release (if you want/need it) into PlugIns/ThirdParty
  + Only the global injector version of Special K supports custom ReShade, you can
      select between official / custom under the PlugIns menu

   >> The custom version includes:
    * Gamepad / keyboard support on config menu
    * Per-game presets, textures and shaders
     + Place Textures in Documents/My Mods/SpecialK/Profiles/<App Name>/ReShade/Textures
     + Place Shaders in Documents/My Mods/SpecialK/Profiles/<App Name>/ReShade/Shaders
    * Always loads a game's preset on start, instead of the last used preset


0.8.33

 + Fixed low-resolution issues with the EULA window
 + Most analytical graphs are now multi-colored instead of trying to determine
     a single color to represent the quality of the entire dataset.
 + Added new options to the framerate limiter (disabled by default) to continue
     driving a game's window message pump if it renders from the same thread as it
       handles input.
  >> Should reduce input latency and help in games like FFX
  >> You must turn Busy-Wait limiting off in order to use this


0.8.32

  * Profile Name Collision Avoidance
 ====================================

 + Global Injector Profiles for Steam games use the application name as defined by the game's manifest
   >> Prior to this, they used <app_name.exe>, which was too generic.

 + This is a two-stage process that involves booting SteamAPI up to determine the AppID and then
     parsing the manifest.

   >> Translation and mapping data for each game is maintained in a new AppCache\... directory structure
   >> Profile migration occurs automatically, but for some games my overlay may not render correctly
        the first time you run a pre-migrated game.
   >> In some cases, deleting the original <app_name.exe> directory may even be necessary.

 + Later versions of Special K will allow blacklisting launchers and other components that share Steam AppIDs


0.8.31

 + Fixed Steam DRM issues in DOOMx64 and a couplf of other OpenGL games
 + Added a battery meter to the framepacing widget
 + Added an option to draw a border around widgets

 * Added support for gamepad manipulation of widgets
 ===================================================
  > Enter gamepad exclusive input mode, then hold Square (PlayStation) or X (Xbox)
      and select a widget by pressing the shoulder buttons.
  > Moving a widget can be done by holding Square / X and moving the left analog stick
  > Double-tapping the Cross (PlayStation) or A (Xbox) buttons will open widget config
 
 + Removed Alt+F4 input hack for Trails of Cold Steel; it is obsolete


0.8.30

 [.3]
  + Added D3D11 Graphics Pipeline Widget, it displays most of the important stats from the
      shader analytics feature (Ctrl + Shift + R) over a 5 to 10-second history.
  + Added D3D11 SwapChain Menu, I'll fill the stuff in with tooltips later.
   >> This mostly benefits Windows 10 users
  + Fixed Trails of Cold Steel Alt+F4 behavior so it no longer exits if you're trying to
      close a different program
  + Added 1 frame swapchain latency in Flip Mode to ensure G-Sync doesn't destroy timing :)
   >> Will make this an option and restore the original latency reducing measures for
        non-G-Sync users in a future update.

 [.2]
  + Added CPU Monitor as an official widget, with OSD config and all
  + Added grid rulers for docked widgets while moving them
  + Added option to disable resizing widgets
  + Added persistent storage of widget positions
  + Added user-defined min/max size constraints to widgets
  + Fixed keybind parsing problems with numpad and Left/Right Alt keys

 [.1]

  >> Right click those widgets to open a config menu for them
 + Fixed DDRAW / D3D8 wrapper problems
 + Corrected scaling on menus


0.8.29

 + The peak volume meter is now a histogram, assigned color based on channel
 + Peak volume moves left / right depending on channel
 + Added very early GPU hardware stat graphs to a new GPU widget
 + Mouse cursor and input behavior when interacting with widgets is more intuitive
  >> You can even move them around without the config menu open
 + Fixed Dark Souls 3 Texture Cache reference leaks
 + Disabled a few of the optimizations from 0.8.28 for compatibility with GeForce Experience
  >> Will investigate further in the future


0.8.28

 + Removed tooltips from graph data views
 + Fixed G-Sync status query in D3D9 games
 + Added minimum flush interval for log I/O (100 ms default)
 + Coalesced all INI file output into a single buffered write for improved
     disk I/O performance
 + Restored multi-threaded DLL analysis at startup (performance)


0.8.27

 + Added OSD Widgets (framepacing and CPU load)
  >> Will polish these off later, they're just toys for now.
 + Changed Special K's config menu to work similar to a Mac, for easier access
     to the branches sub-menu at lower resolutions
 + Fixed various Windows 7 issues


0.8.26

 + Added G-Sync status to framerate readout on OSD
 + Cleaned up log formatting, turn wordwrap off to appreciate the changes ;)
 + Various DLL Loader compliance issues have been fixed (in third-party software),
     including using incorrect paths, wrong flags, etc.
   >> I am likely to encounter broken software that relied on the original undefined
        behavior, I'll fix it when it causes problems :)
   >> This change actuall solves a few oddball problems in the meantime
 + Added mouse warp deadzone configuration to the control panel for games with obnoxious
     mouselook.
 + Fixed occasional Wbem Locator issues caused by the Steam Overlay
   >> The reason that CPU stats, etc. can take several seconds to load is because the Steam 
        overlay holds a thread sync lock on the service needed for those stats. The reason
          those stats sometimes crash games is ... because the Steam overlay holds a lock.
   >> Tsk, tsk, Steam - other people need those services too, damit :)


0.8.25:

 + Fixed mouse input in Mouse Effect: Andromeda, *AGAIN*.
 + Officially supports dinput8.dll injection; the compatibility menu does not offer this
     as one of its choices, but it will eventually.
  >> dinput8.dll, for games that use this, has the greatest chance of working with fullscreen
       video capture software.
 + Improved keyboard input processing, particularly how it behves while in Input Exclusive mode
     and you trigger the keybinding to toggle the config menu.
  >> This is preparing for customizable keybindings, I've been promising them for a long time :)
 + Fixed occasional right-to-left window orientation problems in 64-bit builds
 + Fixed D3D11 reference counting underflows in some games, especially when a third-party
     render enhancing mod is present.
 + Fixed rare texture cache hash collision problem for textures that are removed from the cache
     because a graphics engine has altered them.


0.8.24.4:

 + Fix deadlock caused by MSI Nahimic due to hotpatching 32-bit code
  >> Add MORE padding bytes than the x86 ABI requires because Nahimic is borked

0.8.24.3:

 + Fixed all known multi-threaded rendering problems (Dishonored2 can be debugged now).
 + Reduced texture cache overhead
 + Improved WMI monitoring performance

0.8.24.1 / 2:

 + [SKIM]  Added option to start SKIM automatically during install and to system tray
 + [SKIM]  Added list of (64-bit) programs currently injected and a confirmation if you
             attempt to stop injection while a program is using Special K.
 + [SKIM]  Added tooltip to system tray icon
 + [D3D11] Added support for changing fullscreen display scaling mode while your game is
             running; should make using centered scaling modes a bit more intuitive.
 + [Misc]  Added injection stats to Help menu, mouseover Global Injector version to see
             basic information about games recently played.


0.8.21:

 + [SKIM]   Changed system tray icon (to another KDE icon =P) so that it is easier to
              recognize
 + [XInput] Fix for games that use XInputGetStateEx (...) without allocating the correct
              memory size for the data structure (+1 DWORD)
 + [D3D11]  Reduced D3D11 API overhead in games that stream memory-mapped textures when
              texture caching is enabled but the render mod window is not open
 + [SKIM]   Using +Inject or -Inject commandline switches starts SKIM minimized to the
              tray; left-click the icon in the try to restore it
 + [SKIM]   Branch migration takes effect immediately in all software except for the
              global injector
 + [SKIM]   Only one instance of SKIM can run simultaneously, minimized instances will
              be restored if a new instance is launched
 + [SKIM]   The commandline switch -Inject will now kill any running injection instances
              and exit

             texture mod tools.
 + [D3D11] Added option to replace 24-bit Depth Buffer with 32-bit
 + [D3D11] Improved multi-threaded safety in the D3D11 mod tools for games that draw
             from multiple threads.
 + [SKIM]  Added support to minimize SKIM v 0.7.0+ to the System Tray and have it
             manage global injection for the end-user.

 + Fixed late initialization problems if compat menu is dismissed by pressing OK
 + Added version to compatibility menu
 + Improved compatibility menu and update menu's input focus behavior


0.8.18:
 
 + Added version info to wrapper DLL installations; updating is not supported
 + Installing a wrapper DLL through the compat menu now copies the config from the
     global profile.
 + Uninstalling a wrapper DLL copies the local config back to the global profile
 + Fixed G-Sync indicator in D3D11


0.8.17:

 + Added Last-Known-RenderAPI to Special K's INI file to help with the auto-detect
     mechanism on the compatibility menu
 + Corrected scenario where having a local API wrapper version of Special K in-place
     and one of the API virtual files (i.e. SpecialK.d3d9) would cause both DLLs to
       load.
 + Temporarily re-enabled auto-update.

     problems when the CBT hook inevitably tries to re-inject the DLL.

0.8.12:

 + Removed legacy command console code (low-level keyboard hook, message pump)
