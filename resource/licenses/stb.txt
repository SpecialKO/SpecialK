// stb_textedit.h - v1.9  - public domain - Sean Barrett
// Development of this library was sponsored by RAD Game Tools
//
// This C header file implements the guts of a multi-line text-editing
// widget; you implement display, word-wrapping, and low-level string
// insertion/deletion, and stb_textedit will map user inputs into
// insertions & deletions, plus updates to the cursor position,
// selection state, and undo state.
//
// It is intended for use in games and other systems that need to build
// their own custom widgets and which do not have heavy text-editing
// requirements (this library is not recommended for use for editing large
// texts, as its performance does not scale and it has limited undo).
//
// Non-trivial behaviors are modelled after Windows text controls.
