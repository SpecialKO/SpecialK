22.8.2-D3D9-IK
==============
 + Added automatic Large Address Aware .exe patch when 32-bit non-LAA games crash
 + Fixed rare issue with control panel sliding to the left when scaling is active

22.8.1.1-D3D9-IK
================
 + Fixed jittery text on latency analysis widget
 + Fixed framepacing widget debug view crashing in non-DXGI graphics APIs
 + Added automatic global injection delay for .NET software
 + SteamAPI integration is auto-disabled in games that use Manual Callback Dispatch
     in order to prevent deadlock (fixes Tererria / Lords of Xulima)

22.8.1-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Split D3D9Ex override INI cfg into ForceD3D9Ex and EnableFlipEx (D3D9 Flip Model)
 + Fixed SteamAPI process abort in Control during achievement user statistics fetch
 + Added texture name to dumped texture metadata file for D3D11 engines that include
     debug names in retail games (i.e. Unity)

 + Added D3D9 Managed Pool -> D3D9Ex Default Pool memory mgmt. to support D3D9Ex
 + Fixed D3D9 texture dumping for certain DXT1-5 texture allocations

22.7.29-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added 10 second global injection delay to executables with "Launcher" in name
     (Fixes Final Fantasy 8)
 + Fixed screenshots in D3D12 software with third-party resolution overrides
 + Fixed local injection as "dxgi.dll" if VBLANK Virtualization bypass is enabled

22.7.25-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added DXGI 1.6 Dynamic Refresh Rate (VBLANK Virtualization) Bypass

   >> This bypass is applied by default on Windows 11 systems

    * Think of DRR as DPI Scaling for Refresh Rate
     
   Software has to declare itself Dynamic Refresh Aware effectively, or Windows
     is going to hide VSYNC timing information from the software and give it a
       fake, floaty VSYNC instead

    The bypass can be turned off in SK's INI using the following new setting:

      [Render.DXGI]
      DisableVirtualizedBlanking=false

  + Improved HDR -> SDR tonemap quality in Screenshots

22.7.19-NOCEGUI

     from starting
 + Blacklisted Days Gone's launcher and error reporter utility

22.6.28.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed D3D11 games lacking support for Unordered Access Views on their
     SwapChain from crashing in HDR

22.6.28-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed / reduced HDR issues in Tales of Arise (turn off 11-bit Remastering)
 + Semi-broken Adaptive Tonemap mode...
 + Added color gamut visualizer to HDR widget (D3D11 only)
 + Fixed issues with HDR in D3D12, crashing and missing widget options

22.6.26-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added new experimental 128-bit color remastering option, cause why not?
 + Optimized luminance analysis compute shaders, feel free to keep
     adaptive tonemapping enabled
 - ACES tonemap is currently broken, don't use it :)

22.6.25-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added optional 'Adaptive Tonemap' mode to handle scenes too bright for HGIG

   >> This adds a Compute Shader stage that may use 1-2% extra GPU, so leave it
        off if performance is already tight in a game.

 - ACES tonemap is currently broken, don't use it :)

22.6.24-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed HDR gamut clamp on scRGB Passthrough Mode
 - ACES tonemap is currently broken, don't use it :)

22.6.22-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added new tooltips to the HDR Widget and Display Profiler to explain calibration
 + Fixed incorrect number of 32-bit values in D3D12 Root Signature for HDR processing
 + Re-implemented HDR color saturation slider in ACEScg colorspace
 + Fixed D3D11 render state leaks (depth buffer / tessellation) in HDR image processing

22.6.20.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Added "Export" button to the HDR widget to export the currently selected preset for
     use in other games.

    >> Load exported presets using the "Reset" button.

22.6.20.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Added HDR peak white clipping configuration for displays that do not have valid EDID

    >> See the "Profile Display Capabilities" button in the HDR widget for more info,
         the goal is to find the smallest value that turns the test patterns pure white

     Once saved, the new maximum luminance will be used for HDR range visualizations
       (i.e. HDR vs. Max Local Luminance) to indicate when an image is too bright.

22.6.20-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed Windows Version check in Project Diva's first patch
 + Fixed >60 FPS mod for Project Diva


22.6.18.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed accidental pre-multiplied alpha blending on HDR image process in D3D12

22.6.18-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed black-point compensation causing HDR full white to clip in HGIG
 + Fixed Steam Overlay HDR luminance control if D3D11 State Tracking is disabled

22.6.17.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Hid the HDR Perceptual Boost sliders in an "Experimental" tab
 + Added Tonemap Curve / Grayscale Visualization mode to HDR widget

    >> The goal when tuning things using this new visualization is to
         get the end-point as near as possible to the top-right.

   ( SK comes pre-tuned (preset 0) for LG OLEDS - 800 nits (HGIG) clipping )

     * LG OLEDs do not have valid EDID values for max/avg. luminance, so
         it is not possible to correctly tune the tonemap curve yet.

    >> A tool to find your display's -actual- HDR clipping points will be
         added in a later build; this is more for TVs than monitors.

22.6.17-NOCEGUI
===============
  + Merge pull request #8 from WallSoGB:
     "R and B color switch fix for D3D9 ImGUI when alpha is disabled"
  + Improved WinRing0 Driver Management

22.6.16-NOCEGUI
===============
 + "Reset" now resets the active preset's perceptual parameters
 + Perceptual Boost HDR mode is on by default for HDR preset #0
 + Perceptual Boost parameters are now stored per-preset
 + Fixed a problem with Yakuza engine games destroying DXGI adapters
     SK is holding references to so the busted engine will not crash

22.6.15.3-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Standard logging is now silent when loaded via SKIF or RunDLL32, to prevent deadlock

22.6.15.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Prevent SKIF from recursively spawning driver install if not elevated to Admin
 + Merge pull request #4 from cathyjf   [ SK_LoadImportModule: Expand environment variables ]
 + Merge pull request #7 from WallSoGB  [ Fix "Show OSD in Video Capture" in OGL-IK         ]

22.6.15.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fallback to Documents\My Mods\SpecialK if path is unreadable or
     if it cannot be created.
 + Special K now uses "HKCU\Software\Kaldaien\Special K\Path" to find
     the shared centralized directory for profiles, plug-ins, etc.

22.6.14.4-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Perceptual Boost HDR mode now works in D3D12 titles
 + Added HUD shader definitions for The Quarry for HUDless screenshots
 + Fixed audio stutter in The Quarry due to wrong thread priorities
 + Fixed multiple calls issued per-ID3D11DeviceContext::UpdateSubresource (...) when hooked and wrapped
 + Added protection for games that change thread priority while an SK thread priority override is active
 + Merge pull request #6 from WallSoGB  [ Corrected Intel CPU power and clock readings ]

22.6.12.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Changed SK's ResizeBuffers skip to issue unsynchronized Presents as many times as necessary to get
     the SwapChain backbuffer index to wrap-around to 0 before the function returns.
     
     This reproduces the side-effects of a successful D3D12 IDXGISwapChain3::ResizeBuffers (...) call
 
   -> Fixes compat. with The Quarry in D3D12

22.6.12-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added support for middle-gray contrast and color saturation adjustment to Passthrough tonemap mode
 + Added range tests to prevent NaN (black pixels that bleed through UI) during tonemapping
 + Added sliders to the HDR widget to make tuning Perceptual Boost easier
 + Bumped the Color Saturation slider's maximum up to 140%

22.6.11-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Made Perceptual Boost into a mode rather than a Tonemap (refer to the new checkbox in HDR widget)
 + Extra tuning parameters have been added when PB is enabled.
 
   >> The first two control overall brightness and the second two can scale things back if
        mid-tone detail is being lost.

22.6.9-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Added ACES Filmic + Perceptual Boost Tonemap Mode to HDR Widget

    >> Increases perceptual brightness slightly, make sure to check the vs. Max Average Luminance
         visualization to ensure clipping is not taking place -- maximum luminance target may need
           to be lowered.

 + Fixed white/black objects in some D3D11 games that use Multisampled RenderTargets

22.6.8.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Fixed brightness of ImGui UI in sRGB
 + Added sRGB framebuffer status when flip model override is active
 + Added locking to INI file write/parse to prevent rare crashes when opening SK's control panel

22.6.8-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Add support for ID3D11Resource and ID3D11Texture2D1 to SwapChain wrapper when DXGI Flip Model
     is being forced on
 + Added support for rendering ImGui into multisampled non-Flip SwapChain backbuffers
 + Improved MSAA resolve for sRGB games when flip model is active
 + Fixed various sRGB issues and removed confirmation dialog when forcing flip in an sRGB game

22.6.2-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Removed most default config overrides for Hatsune Miku, including the default 60 FPS limit
 + Hatsune Miku's framerate limiter is now completely disabled except in game menus,
     whether or not Special K has a framerate limit set.

   * VSYNC becomes the default framerate limiting mechanism; users are encouraged to turn
       SK's framerate limiter on in the control panel (it will auto-match refresh rate).

22.6.1-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Separate High FPS mod for Hatsune Miku no longer required, just set SK's framerate limit
     * Menus will be locked to 60 FPS or your limit (whichever is lowest) for proper gameplay
 + Installing Special K locally for Hatsune Miku disables its stutter inducing network code
     * This code is unrelated to leaderboards.

22.5.31-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Enabled SK's dynamic spinlock feature in Hatsune Miku to minimize audio/render desync 
 + Configured default settings for Hatsune Miku to minimize latency at 60 FPS w/o Latent Sync

     * If you did not read the original thread for this game, reset your config

    -- Thread explaining ideal configuration was deleted when Valve banned me.

      Summary of information lost thanks to Valve:

        > Setup 16-bit / 44.1 or 48 kHz Sample Rate in Windows
        > Setup a 60 FPS limit (game's averages 60.5 - 64)
        > Consider Latent Sync if your display is 60 Hz
        > Mod for >60 FPS: https://sk-data.special-k.info/misc/DivaModLoader_HighRefresh.zip

22.5.30-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Patched failure prone Windows (10+) version check code out of Hatsune Miku Project DIVA
   >> Game has been tested and works on Windows 8... might even work in 7 (SK will not! :P)

22.5.29-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Improved compatibility with Disgaea 5 (uses more than 128 D3D11 device contexts)
 + Fixed incorrect D3D11 Shader State Tracking introduced after 21.07.23
 + Set D3D11 "Low Spec Mode" by default (new config files only) to minimize
     state tracking performance overhead in high drawcall games

22.5.28-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added Extended Model/Family to CPUID for Intel CPUs
 + Made D3D12 Feature Level 12_2 optional depending on build environment's WDK version

22.5.27-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Updated compiler requirements in README
 + Removed single-threaded limitations from Hatsune Miku Project DIVA Mega Mouthful+

22.5.15-NOCEGUI

22.4.20-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Removed a few texture scaling artifacts in Chrono Cross

22.4.19.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Improved 60 FPS functionality for Chrono Cross
 + Added 1440p / 4K resolution modes to Chrono Cross
 + Added protection against launchers clobbering actual game INI files

22.4.17-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Handle RTV/SRV destruction occurring while Render Mod Tools window is open

22.4.15.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed initialization races in some widgets if drawn on frame 0
 + Fixed potential DXGI Do Not Sequence + Restart flags on first frame
 + Avoid calling ResizeTarget (...) on redundant Fullscreen mode changes
 + Added support for Multisample Resolve between UNORM and FP buffers
 + Improved HDR support (pipeline remaster w/o MSAA) in Chrono Cross

22.4.15.1-NOCEGUI

===============
 + Added Frame Pacing Fixes for Chrono Cross
 + Added optional compressed fonts for Chrono Cross for users whose drivers
     cannot run the game and report "Out of Memory"

   *) See: https://sk-data.special-k.info/misc/SK_ChronoCross_FontFix.7z

        SK_Res\...

22.4.11.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed calling the DLL import version of GetSystemCpuSetInformation (...)
 + Improved HDR black point compensation for less grayscale banding near-black

22.4.10.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed OpenGL-IK displaying a black screen when flip model is enabled

22.4.10.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed a number of issues related to fullscren refresh rate overrides in D3D11
 + Improved reliability of fullscreen mode transitions while using Flip Model

  >> Special K is now a virus... according to Discord.

    ] Uploads now have to be encrypted, or Discord deletes them and then replaces
        the original message with something stupid about cooking.

      * Password:  skummy   , as in that's a really scummy thing to do Discord.

22.4.10-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed a few Structured Exception Handling stack unwinds
 + Added skeleton implementation of D3D9-IK, non-functional, just enough to test
     whether and where this will crash D3D9 games when finished.

22.4.9.2-NOCEGUI
================
 + Fixed a rare race to initialize framerate limiter that could result in an
     integer divide by zero.
 + Set the default AutoStopBehavior for SKIF to Auto-Stop On First Frame

     >> This option has lower compatibility than Stop When Game Exits, but
          will result in far fewer arguments

22.4.9.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Added SKIF Auto-Stop Behavior Configuration to SK (belongs in SKIF, but whatever)

     Refer to "Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Global\platform.ini"

       [SKIF.System]
       AutoStopBehavior={0|1|2|...}

         0: Auto-Stop Never
         1: Auto-Stop when a game first starts
         2: Auto-Stop when a game exits        [Default]

     Anything else:  Stop whenever SK feels like it, including if the game crashes


22.4.9-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Added support for SwapChain-based MSAA when using Flip Model / HDR

     (Chrono Cross is 8x MSAA by default, and works as intended now)

22.4.8.3-NOCEGUI
================
 + Changed SK's Injection Success Event to not signal if SKIF has explicitly
     been configured not to stop injection.
 + Added Chrono Cross's launcher to internal injection blacklist
 + Fixed Flip Discard emulation discarding the wrong surface in fullscreen mode

22.4.8.2-NOCEGUI
================
 + Added XInputGetKeystroke (...) hook to correctly block input while SK's control panel
     is active in games that use buffered-input for XInput rather than polling.

22.4.8.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Changed behavior of Fullscreen + Borderless slightly, it now will always adjust both
     the window size and framebuffer resolution.

     * This is helpful for games that had odd-ball resolutions preventing flip model,
         such as Final Fantasy XIV. But it's also a departure from previous design.

     Because the Borderless + Fullscreen option now always matches window and framebuffer,
       it may cause problems with games that have options for sub-native resolution windows.

      >> You should turn SK's "Fullscreen" option off in those cases, or use SK's Display
           menu instead to select a desktop resolution to run Borderless+Fullscreen.

  + Corrected long-standing issue in Horizon Zero Dawn where its Fullscreen mode would add
      a window border rather than remove it when SK was used :)

22.4.8-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Created Plug-In for ELEX2 to speed file I/O (load screens) up by a factor of 100x

     >> Not joking, load screens go from 2 minutes to instant.

22.4.7.2-NOCEGUI
================
 + Added proxy backbuffer surfaces for non-flip (D3D11) games to support fullscreen

22.4.7.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Fixed D3D12 "Fullscreen Mode" (lol) in some games after Alt+Tab

22.4.7-NOCEGUI
==============
 *** Portable Global Injection ***

   Global Injection supports installing to arbitrary paths now, profiles and all
     supporting assets will be loaded relative to the directory that SpecialK32.dll
       and SpecialK64.dll are in.

    You can keep entirely different installs of Special K if that's your thing, just
      put SKIF and Special K's DLLs in their own directory :)


22.4.6.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Fixed resource management crash in Death Stranding Director's Cut (D3D12)
 + Added an options dialog to turn on 'Force Windowed' mode or disable Flip Model
     in games that fail to transition into / out of fullscreen exclusive (D3D11)

22.4.6-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Improved reliability of Fullscreen Exclusive workaround in D3D11.

     => Alt + Enter generally doesn't work for games that have had
          Flip Model forced on, but mode changes requested from the
            game's control panel should work.

22.4.4-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Added recovery mechanism for games that fail to correctly engage
     Fullscreen Exclusive while DXGI Flip Model is enabled (D3D11)
 + Fixed HDR paper white setting not scaling correctly for Rec 709 luminance

22.4.3.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + New performance logging rules prevent RTSS from flooding logs with timer
     resolution change messages
 + Changed initialization order for framerate limiter / scheduler to minimize
     timing interference from third-party software

22.4.3-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Special K's local copies of XInput and dbghelp DLLs from System32 are now
     checked to make sure they are the same version as the DLLs stored in System32,
       and will update themselves otherwise.

 + Bypass software that may be setting per-process timer resolution higher (worse)
     than intended via repeated calls to NtSetTimerResolution / timeBeginPeriod.

    >> This -seems- to be a bug in Windows, because it should not be possible for
         the timer resolution of a process to change while SK has these functions
           nop'd.

    * Fix is only applied while SK's framerate limiter is engaged, so always? ;)

22.4.2.2-NOCEGUI
================
 + Added a preference under the HDR Menu for SK's automatic HDR On/Off feature
 + HDR menu now shows in Control Panel for users with HDR capable displays running
     on SDR desktop (previously it only showed if desktop HDR was enabled)

22.4.2.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Code cleanup and race condition removal
 + AVX2 DLL size reduced, offers marginal gains, but free performance is always nice

  >> Rename AVX2 DLL to simply SpecialK64.dll to use it instead of the normal SSE2 version.

22.4.2-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Slight improvements to 10-bpc SDR mode (D3D9/11/12)
 + Handle dummy window creation by third-party overlays and mods better,
     so that they don't trigger assertion failures when SK can't figure out
       which window is supposed to be handling input.
 + Added AVX2 version of Special K (64-bit), probably will not have much effect, but
     I am curious :)

22.4.1.2-NOCEGUI
================
 + Added option to force 10-bpc in SDR (D3D9/D3D11/D3D12), stability not guaranteed

     [Display.Output]
     Force10bpcSDR=true ; Possibly broken game, hurray! :)

    [ 10-bpc screenshots are not supported in D3D9 yet ]

 + Fixed a number of VSYNC related issues in D3D9 games

    * Tooltip in control panel now reports correct values
    * Forcing present interval 0 correctly turns off VSYNC (when fullscreen exclusive)
    * Resolution, Format and VSYNC Overrides are applied at D3D9 device creation instead
        of delaying them until the first device reset (Alt+Enter / Alt-Tab)

22.4.1.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Fixed potential crash during shutdown in Tales of Arise

22.4.1-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Added additional device (integrated/discrete) GPU selection info to OpenGL-IK logs
 + Disable logging for deferred D3D11 contexts Twitch's overlay constantly creates
 + Fixed assertion failure triggered by some overlays when passing invalid shaders
 + Added CD Projekt launchers to internal blacklist

22.3.25.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed HDR-related crash in Ghostwire: Tokyo (D3D12) from SwapChain readback

  >> This game has non-defeatable HDR settings, you can bypass the game's HDR:

      [Render.DXGI]
      HideHDRSupport=true

22.3.25-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added Epic Overlay HDR Color Correction and Luminance Control (D3D11)

22.3.22.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Added 15 frame initialization delay to Elden Ring plug-in to avoid
     compatibility problems with Flawless Widescreen's framerate stuff

22.3.22-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Removed C++20 std::format usage from SK's ini parser for stability reasons
 + Handle a regression in Elden Ring 1.3.2 that uses the old button textures

     >> Elden Ring PS4 button users must re-enable button mods from control panel

22.3.21.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Disable in-process SteamAPI achievement statistics fetch since achievement
     popups are not implemented in NOCEGUI branch

22.3.21.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Control panel's overlay pause feature is now disabled by default
     ( compat hack for "Going Under" )
 + Changed CPU Widget driver install procedure to use SKIF

22.3.20-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added support for SKIFsvc{64|32} to install/uninstall WinRing0

=================
 + Update game speed memory pattern for Elden Ring 1.3.1
 + Elden Ring DualShock 4 controller users should open SK's control panel and
     re-enable PS buttons.

22.3.18-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Updated Elden Ring plug-in with new button texture hash and game speed code
 + Restored normal HDR Peak Luminance behavior for scRGB / ACES Filmic tonemaps

22.3.7-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Added 64-bit Steam AppID support (non-Steam games launched via Steam)
 + Fixed accidental removal of Latent Sync keybind config logic
 + Partially restored D3D9 texture mod support

22.3.6-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Fixed SteamInputAppID not being set to 0 initially
 + Removed libScePad.dll resource dependency from project
 + Fixed wrong game speed value being written to Elden Ring INI

22.3.5-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Reduced D3D12 Copy Command Allocator overhead in Elden Ring
 + Testing alternate Thread Pool scheduling to fix 'EzWorkPool' dumping all
     of its threads onto core 0/2 in Elden Ring

    >> Set [SpecialK.System] GameOutput=false to opt-in

       * Consult the Thread Widget to confirm 'Ez...' threads are being
           distributed to different CPU cores.

22.3.4.3-NOCEGUI
================
 + Optimized overlapping D3D12 HDR / Texture Injection code that was activating for HDR
     users without texture mods present
 + Elden Ring's Priority Inversion fix applies correct default state when toggled

22.3.4.2-NOCEGUI
================
 + Added in-game option to download and install PlayStation buttons in Elden Ring

22.3.4.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Fixed recent changes to memory pattern scanning that caused NieR: Automata's
     plug-in to scan past the end of commited executable memory

  .1) Fixed the fix for NieR breaking Elden Ring, ugh.

================
 + Fixed compatibility with "PauseEldenRing" mode
 + Forcefully disable SteamAPI friend achievement fetch so achievements unlock

22.3.2-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Elden Ring Framerate Limit code is pattern-scanned and patched accordingly now,
     no updates required for compatibility with future patches.
 + Elden Ring plug-in init deferred until first frame drawn to fix deadlocks if
    config takes a long time.

22.3.1.3-NOCEGUI
================
 + Updated Elden Ring Plug-In for 3/1/22 patch

22.3.1.2-NOCEGUI

 + Default Elden Ring settings to block KB&M input while Elden Ring game window
     is not focused and keep mouse from leaving game window while it is focused

22.3.1.1-NOCEGUI
================
 + Handle ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER during D3D12 Shader Pipeline Library creation
    ( fixes startup hangs in Elden Ring )

22.3.1-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Elden Ring settings are now saved in INI persistently
 + Elden Ring Prio. Inversion fix only applied if render thread is Below Normal
 + Disabled SteamAPI friend achievement sync. for Elden Ring

22.2.28.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Injecting SK _late_ into a Flip Model game that knows what DXGI tearing
     flags are no longer triggers an assertion failure

22.2.28.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed issue with Priority Inversion workaround not applying correctly
 + Fixed Steam Overlay so that it works in Elden Ring

22.2.28-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added D3D12 pipeline library (shader cache) flush if Elden Ring tries to
    use a stale / invalid cache from old driver version or changed hardware.

    >> Pipeline caching would otherwise not work at all after driver update

22.2.27-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Ignore EAC's launch window to prevent SKIF auto-stop in Elden Ring

22.2.26.5-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Added Thread Priority Inversion fix for Elden Ring

22.2.26.3-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Updated framerate limiter code for Elden Ring 1.0.2.1
 + Added Elden Ring control panel section
 + Uncapped framerate during cinematics

22.2.26-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added EAC Disable Feature for Elden Ring
 + Added framreate limiter fixes for Elden Ring
 + Fixed some ImGui rendering issues when displaying UTF16 text

22.2.25-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Improved D3D11 resolution / window resize performance
 + Fixed an issue that was preventing screenshot functions from working in D3D11/12

22.2.24-NOCEGUI
===============
 + DualSense controller support extended to God of War

22.2.23-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Improved framerate limiter accuracy during arithmetic overflow edge-cases
 + Workaround irregular libScePad polling in Dying Light 2 in menus

22.2.22.968-NOCEGUI
===================
 + Fix frozen screen issues in some non-Flip compliant games (i.e. CrossCode)
 + Improved global hook standby performance (waiting for 'Stop Service')
 + Removed embedded sound files from SK's DLLs

     >> Previously built-in sounds now live in "Assets/Shared/Sounds/..."

22.2.22-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Upgraded build tools to Visual Studio 2022
 + D3DX9, Tobii Stream Engine and WinRing0 are no longer packed into SK's DLL;
     these are now downloaded on-first-use from SK's CDN.

22.2.21-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Eliminated locking caused by unsafe DllMain in NvCameraWhitelisting (ANSEL)
 + Added pre-defined PlayStation + Button combos for:

     Screenshot:                      PS + Share
     Latent Sync FCAT Bar Toggle:     PS + L3
     Latent Sync +5 Scanline Offset:  PS + Up
     Latent Sync -5 Scanline Offset:  PS + Down

   Holding PS for 20 frames or pressing and releasing PS without activating
   one of the button combos above will open the control panel

    - Currently only works in games that use native DualShock/DualSense

        (i.e. Dying Light 2)

    These will be customizable in the future, after figuring out an Xbox equiv.

     * Use DS4Windows if you actually want to use SK's control panel after
         opening it using PS; also set DS4Win's PS button binding to "Unset" :)

22.2.20.3-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed even more issues with deadlock in Dying Light 2
 + Updated software licenses and copyleft SK 2022

22.2.20.2-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fixed a rare deadlock in dbghelper.dll during game startup
 + Added WM_DEVICECHANGE stutter mitigation for Monster Hunter Rise and other
     games with poor gamepad hot-plug performance

22.2.20.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Epic's Overlay is driving me nuts reloading Steamclient64.dll every 150 ms,
     SK now pins that DLL so that it cannot be unloaded.

       [+] This DLL pinning behavior can be disabled w/ [Steam.Log] Silent=true

 + Added option to enable/disable PlayStation button opening SK's control panel
 + Changed mute button to mute game instead of changing input capture
 + Share -> Touchpad Click, Mute Button and PlayStation Button behavior are
     stored in Global\input.ini now instead of per-game

     >> Trackpad disable is still per-game, since some games kinda need it (!)

   Gamepad-specific bindings are now a practical feature since SK has access
     to a button that no game can use (or even see) -- the PlayStation button.

       [[ not implemented ]]
       ---------------------
       ( i.e. PS + L2 ==> Screenshot   or   PS + L3 ==> Toggle HUD )

   If any SK functions come to mind that normally require a keyboard, but
     would be handy using a gamepad, please share while this stuff is fresh :)

22.2.20-NOCEGUI
===============
 + DualShock / DualSense users can now open SK's control panel by pressing the
     PlayStation button (in games that use libScePad for enhanced PS input)
 + Mute button on PlayStation controllers can be used to toggle SK's UI input
     capture mode (e.g. play game while control panel is open)
 + Added options to disable touchpad input (PS-native games) and
     map the Share button to trackpad touch

      >> All notes assume, unless otherwise stated, the pad is wired via USB

22.2.19.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Fix back and forth button icon switching in Dying Light 2 if a DualSense
     controller is used while DS4Windows is active.

22.2.19-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Add input blocking (and API status) functionality for games that use
     PlayStation's native API (libScePad.dll)
 + Additional protection for EGS games with invalid manifests

22.2.18-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed potential crashes for EGS games with manifests that do not match
     the locally installed game
 + Fixed black screens due to Multisampled Depth/Stencil in Dear Esther when
     promoting to Flip Model  ( Color is single-sampled, D/S must also be )

22.2.6-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Removed 8.3 DOS Filename warnings, "Restart Game" becomes "Exit Game"
     on systems that lack support.
 + Removed warnings for staging textures that are only partially updated by
     the game engine (D3D11)
 + Changed Latent Sync's Scanline Adjust keybinds to +/- 5 Scanlines and
     apply the new sync point immediately.

22.2.5-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Added HDR Setup button to Display menu for compatible displays
 + Added protection against changing SwapChain backbuffer count in D3D12
 + Added checks to prevent overriding SwapChain backbuffer count using a
     number of buffers smaller than the engine originally requested.

22.2.4-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Fixed HDR crash at startup in D3D12 mode in Dying Light 2

22.2.2-NOCEGUI
==============
 + Defaulted most of SK's widgets to click-through: enable

    † Reset global OSD INI for changes to take hold on existing installs
    ‡ Exceptional Widgets (break rules; not "amazing widgets" :P)

          1. HDR Widget
          2. Thread Profiler Widget

    Right-click a widget while the SK control panel is active to change a
      click-through enabled widget to work even when control panel is closed

22.2.1-NOCEGUI
==============
 + The SK_Res\Achievements directory no longer removes the 'Initialize Texture Mods'
     menu option from the File menu
 + Automagically blacklist SK from injection into Windows Terminal and many other
     non-game UWP applications that use graphics and game input APIs
 + Added additional protection against injection into user interactive service hosts

     >> SK's not a threat to them, however, they tend to stop responding to SK's DLL
          unload broadcast message and the DLL should bounce out immediately instead.

 + Fixed some games not registering window re-activation when using Multitasking-On-Top
 + Changed SteamInput code to apply only when exiting a process that has drawn at
     least one frame
 + DualShock / DualSense controllers will not work with SK unless SteamInput is
     disabled and DS4Windows is used instead or they are plugged in via USB and SK is
       set to use DirectInput instead of XInput (gamepad settings)

22.1.31-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fix typo in HTTP status code logging that might crash on 300 range responses
 + Fix C++17 std::filesystem time vs. system clock epoch in cache age calculations

===============
 + Improved caching behavior for Achievement data.

22.1.28-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added caching and non-SteamAPI based achievement stat collection

22.1.27-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Reduced Start/Stop Injection delay from 50 ms to 15 ms
 + No longer issue steam://forceinputappid/ commands if Steam is not running
 + Changed Steam achievement icon pre-fetching to use SK's cloud server

22.1.24-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added achievement icon pre-fetch for Steam and EOS (SK_Res\Achievements\...)

22.1.23-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Added Texture Cache / Mod support for D3D11 Mipmap Clamped Textures (God of War)

22.1.22-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Fixed potential buffer overrun while calculating Steam friend achievement stats
 + Fixed UTF8 character encoding in EOS achievement text

22.1.21.1-NOCEGUI
=================
 + Implemented File | Restart Game for EGS games (fixes game stuck in background)

22.1.21-NOCEGUI
===============
 + Removed CEGUI and temporarily removed achievement popups along with it
 + The achievement popups will be back, but it's important to test w/ CEGUI gone
     before proceeding to replace that popup with a new ImGui window

  * Render APIs most affected:  D3D9, OpenGL (w/o OpenGL-IK) and D3D11

    D3D12 is unaffected, so all testing should focus on those APIs.


22.1.20.1
=========
 + Improved reliability of temporary desktop resolution override for single-monitor
     users and for multi-monitor users who run the game on the default monitor
 + Flush display name cache when new monitors are powered on/off so that the Display
     menu's monitor list shows correct names

22.1.20
=======
 + Added option to apply a display resolution override while the game is running,
     grants access to optimized borderless window resolutions that would require
       changing display settings manually otherwise.
 + Resolutions changed in the Display menu no longer save to the System Registry
 + Display Management Keybinds are now in the Display menu on single-monitor systems

22.1.5
======
 + Added achievement progress indicator for EGS games
 + Added minimal achievement config for EGS

 - Configuration should be wrapping up in one or two extra releases,
     and CEGUI will be removed in favor of an ImGui-based achievement popup
       that works in D3D12.

22.1.4.1
========
 + Improved AppCache (config name lookup) performance for EGS
 + Stopped loading SteamAPI for GOG / EGS games that ship with SteamAPI DLLs
 + Quicker Start/Stop DLL unload for apps that lock SK's DLL and then suspend

22.1.4
======
 + Epic Game Store titles store config in Profiles\<Localized Game Name>
     instead of <game.exe> now
 + Active game title has been added to the control panel for EGS games

22.1.3
======
 + Added preliminary 'Epic Enhancements' section to control panel

22.1.2
======
 Initial Epic Online Services Integration
 ----------------------------------------
  + Achievement unlock sound has been added to EGS games
  + SK's OSD contextually hides/shows itself in response to Epic overlay state
  + SK can pause EOS overlay aware games when opening the control panel

  There is a lot of overlap in features between SteamAPI and EOS, so the
    Steam control panel will be unified with EOS in later builds. For now all
      of these features are controlled using the Steam INI settings.

22.1.1
======
 + Fixed Epic Online Services overlay occasionally removing SK's global hook
 + GOG, Epic Game Store and Ubisoft games are auto-whitelisted for injection

1.9.9.9 A.D. ラヴォスの日

 + Added throttling mechanism to SKIF's inject Start/Stop to prevent hook races

21.12.29
========
 + Added configurable resolution scaling, texture streaming and shader caching
     for Final Fantasy 7 Remake

    >> FFVIIHook is required for Engine.ini changes to work, consult Nexusmods

21.12.28
========
 + Optimized cursor auto-hide and fixed a cursor-related lockup in Epic Overlay
 + Global Hook teardown delay (333 ms) for apps that exit before DLL cleanup

21.12.23
========
 + Do not activate Ansel with Special K unless you are using a gamepad,
     Ansel's overlay will break keyboard input until you restart the game.

    >> SK's support for Ansel goes as far as preventing it from deadlocking
         if enabled. Its keyboard problems will not be fixed

 + Workaround D3D11 deadlocks caused by Ansel + Epic Game Overlay in D3D12

21.12.22
========
 + Improved C++ Exception Safety in SK's COM Smart Pointer

 + Fix monitor reassignment on systems with gaps in -attached- devices
     and non-increasing sequences following GDI's '\\.\DISPLAYxx'
       naming convention  (e.g. 2,5,4 instead of typical 1,2,3)

   ->>  Internally, SK uses VidPN Path Name to identify monitors  <<-

    ( Game Developers are STRONGLY encouraged to store VidPN Paths
        instead of GDI display index values in config files )

"\\?\DISPLAY#GSMC0A0#5&2dafe0a1&3&UID49410#{e6f07b5f-ee97-4a90-b076-33f57bf4eaa7}"

   ^^^ This is not a user-friendly identifier, but it persists across
         reboots, driver updates and whatever else Windows 11 breaks.

 + Fix GDI memory leak when copying screenshots to clipboard

21.12.20
========
 + Lossless (SDR) screenshots taken in 10-bpc D3D12 games
     will now use 48-bpp PNG to preserve lossless quality
 + Added D3D12 Shader Load Activity to Logs
 + Removed auto-disable G-Sync option from Latent Sync
 + Optimized Latent Sync's signal timing acquisition
 + Optimized framerate limiter for Final Fantasy 7 Remake

21.12.19
========
 + Fixed various build environment issues:

    * Missing tobii_stream_engine_sk{32|64}.lib
    * Missing boost/preprocessor/debug/error.hpp
    * Multiply-defined IID_IDXGIFactory6/7 symbols if using newer dxguid.lib

 + Keybind config for HUDless screenshots only shows up for games with
     SK HUD shader info (d3d11_shaders.ini or built-in)

21.12.18.2
==========
 + Auto-hide mouse cursor (as default config) in Final Fantasy 7 Remake
 + Add HUD shader info to the D3D11 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake

21.12.18.1

 + Added notification when resizing / moving a window to get the game
     to resize the SwapChain and re-engage Independent Flip
 + Improved performance when moving windows between monitors w/ snap
 + Increased whitelist/blacklist limits to 128 * MAX_PATH characters
 + Added XInput UAP Support for Halo Infinite

21.12.6
=======
 + Reduced mouse stutter in games when the hardware cursor is visible
 + Implemented RGB[A]8 -> RGBA16F remastering in OpenGL when scRGB HDR is
     active in the HDR widget

21.12.5
=======
 + Improved OpenGL HDR quality (16bpc in many older titles)

     >> Newer engines that primarily draw to offscreen Renderbuffer Objects
          will see less improvement.

        GL "pipeline remastering" will help in later releases.

21.12.4
=======
 + "Multi-Tasking On Top" no longer requires Global Injection to monitor
     foreground status of other applications

21.12.3
=======
 + "Fixed" (workaround) compiler optimization bug so newer versions of MSVC
     can be used with ImGui
 + Fixed input not passing to other applications when SK's control panel is
     visible and "Disable Mouse / Keyboard Input to Game" is enabled
 + Fixed Tessellation Shader stateblock in D3D Feature Level 10_0/10_1 games
 + Added logging of D3D Debug Layer when no debugger is attached
    >> Also disabled Break-on-Error if nothing is attached to catch it :)

21.12.1
=======
 + Re-enabled OpenGL `ChangeDisplaySettingsEx` call, though warning is still
     displayed in any game that attempts to use it.
 + Fixed mouse input in Prey (2006), but to block mouse warp you need to set
     "Block Mouse when no Cursor is Visible" in SK's Mouse settings
 + Made the G-Sync status line of the control panel selectable with keyboard

21.11.30
========
 + Improved 'TemporaryDesktopHDRMode' mode on systems with single monitors,
     it should correctly turn HDR off at application exit
 + Improved Multi-Tasking On Top's protection against DWM composition when apps
     are snapped to the sides of adjacent monitors

21.11.29.1
==========
 + Changed 'Multi-Tasking On Top' to not raise the game's window when selecting
     an app on a different monitor if the game was _NOT_ already the TopMost
       window on its own monitor

 + Fixed Ctrl + Shift + Backspace not activating the control panel in some games
     when 'Disable Keyboard Input to Game' is selected


21.11.29
========
 + Temporarily disabled 2x and 4x Latent Sync modes to fix black screens
 + Added G-Sync Control Panel (right-click G-Sync status in control panel)

    >> G-Sync and FastSync can be configured per-game

 + Turning on Latent Sync now disables G-Sync; enable FastSync if you need
     G-Sync like functionality while using Latent Sync

21.11.28
========
 + Fixed texture upload performance issues in The Evil Within 1 / 2

 21.11.27
========
 + Fixed first-launch issues on systems without default_SpecialK.ini

21.11.26
========
 + Fixed default_{SpecialK|API}.ini files not being loaded when games launch
     w/o a config file present
 + Fixed [Reset Config] in Compatibility Launch Menu not deleting config files
 + Fixed OpenGL API auto-detect in some games on first launch

     >> NOTE: Using the compatibility menu and selecting 'OpenGL' will disable
                SK's new OpenGL / DX interop features; use 'All APIs' to enable

21.11.25
========
 OpenGL on D3D11
 ---------------
  + New system translates OpenGL display output to D3D11 to make GL games
      compatible with windowed mode G-Sync, Reflex and HDR (SK or AutoHDR)

    Feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting:

      [API.Hook]
      d3d11=false

    Turning off D3D11 support in Special K will use legacy OpenGL


21.11.23.1
==========
 + Updated D3D9 Screenshot Support (keybinds / Steam integration)
 + Added support for X8R8G8B8 D3D9 Screenshots
 + Added support for RGB8 OpenGL Screenshots

21.11.23
========
 + Removed Assertion on Windows 8.1 systems for High-Precision Waitable Timers


 OpenGL Screenshot Support
 -------------------------
  + Added support for GL to SK's multi-threaded screenshot capture / encoder

    > Keybinds for 'HUDless Screenshots' exist, but trigger normal screenshots

  Only RGBA8 (32-bit color) games are supported, no known HDR or 10-bpc OpenGL
    games exist to test on. SK will be adding HDR support to GL, so this will
      change in the future!

  Special Notice for Steam Games:
  ===============================

    Steam screenshot integration may have automatically disabled itself in
      OpenGL games previously run using an older version of SK.

    > Consult the Screenshots section of the Control Panel to re-enable.


21.11.22
========
 + Fixed Deadlocks Caused by OpenGL Shared Context Deletion in Yuzu / Ryujinx
 + Added Sync Interval Clamping, to prevent games from using fractional-rate
     VSYNC instead of a proper framerate limiter.

     Fractional-rate VSYNC disables VRR, a SyncIntervalClamp of 1 will fix
       VRR issues in many games. It is set to 1 by default in these games

         * Forza Horizon 5,  Halo: Infinite,  NieR: Automata / Replicant

       [Render.FrameRate]
       ClampSyncInterval={-1=Unchanged|Maximum Presentation Interval}

21.11.21
========
 + Fixed RawInput Mouse performance at extreme polling rates (i.e. 8 kHz) by
     ensuring games do not sample the same RAWINPUT packet more than once.

   Duplicate processing has very high overhead and was leading to stutter in
     many games, if they need to see duplicate data for some reason they will
       hit SK's input cache now instead of increasing system lock contention.

21.11.20
========
 + Full input support for Halo: Infinite and other buffered RawInput games
 + Fixed issues with unicode path truncation when renaming game profile
     directories using localized titles in 32-bit builds

21.11.19
========
 + Added checkbox to turn on FCAT visualization bars in Latent Sync config
 + Added keybind to toggle FCAT visualization bars (not visible by default)
 + Reduced info shown in Latent Sync config when 'Advanced' tab is not open
 + Removed a few APC queue scheduler assertion messages when I/O Completion
     Status codes are returned but alertable waits are not enabled

21.11.17
========
 + Added support for Forza Horizon 5 and Halo Infinite

    >> For Halo Infinite, use a gamepad to control SK's UI

21.10.30
========
 + Added new Latency Statistics to Framepacing Widget (PresentMon-based)
 + Fixed OpenGL Pixel Unpack Buffer issues in Yuzu that prevented SK's UI
     from rendering correctly

21.10.24
========
 + Improved locale-specific key name support in some ImGui menus

21.10.23
========
 + Added support for GL_ARB_clip_control so that SK's UI is not rendered
     upside down and inside-out in many OpenGL-based emulators

21.10.22
========
 + Added VSYNC options to the Display menu in OpenGL and Direct3D9
 + Added warning in Reflex config if attempting to apply Latency modes on
     a Secondary monitor (framerate will be wrong among other things)
 + Fixed a Windows Defender deadlock when it tries to inject MpDetoursCopy...
    and the Steam Overlay has crashed while holding the DLL loader lock

21.10.21
========
 + Added right-click option to framerate limiter slider w/ pre-computed
     fractional refresh rate limits for optimal fixed-refresh pacing
 + Improved framerate limiter consistency at framerates > 200 FPS

21.10.20
========
 + Fixed Multimedia Class Scheduling in Framerate Limiter
 + Added support for XInput 1.1 and 1.2
 + Battery info now available for Xbox controllers in Steam Input-only games
 + Added NVIDIA Reflex "Nothing But Boost" mode to access the power setting
     without any of the latency-related features :)

21.10.18
========
 + Improved signal timing debug accuracy in framerate limiter
 + Correctly re-position secondary monitors when changing primary
 + Added feature to turn X360 controllers off by clicking their battery icon
 + Fixed null termination issues in paths combined with leading slashes

21.10.16
========
 + Added button to Display menu to make the active monitor the primary monitor
 + Fixed keybind for moving game windows to the primary monitor

 + Fixed a few performance issues in Steam Input; you are still recommended to
     always disable it per-game in Steam games
 + XInput Placeholders will work when Steam Input is trying to break things if
     "Rehook XInput" is enabled

21.10.15
========
 + Added DLL cleanup for software that invokes TerminateProcess (...) on itself
 + Added option to bring SKIF to the foreground when a game exits

    >> Enable this per-game by setting :

         [SpecialK.System]
         ReturnToSKIF=true

       -->  To apply this for all games, add it to Global\master_SpecialK.ini

21.10.13
========
 + Optimized wireless gamepad connect / disconnect
 + Re-enabled XInput placeholders for hot-swapping
 + Added gamepad battery meter to framepacing widget if PresentMon is inactive

 + Added native SteamInput bypass to poll/block gamepad input using XInput 1.1
 + Changed CBT hook removal / signal order during injection shutdown

21.10.12
========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.10.2

   - Fixed Camera Mod compatibility; only adjust timing for uncapped framerates

21.10.11
========
 + Added XInput battery level indicator to control panel and framepacing widget
 + Added XInput activity indicator to denote which gamepad(s) a game is polling
 + Detour all XInput 9.1.0 / 1.3 software through 1.4 for more reliable hooking

21.10.08
========
 + Fixed Far Cry 6 setting HDR metadata even in SDR, causing incorrect colors

21.10.07
========
 + Fixed Global Injection for Ubisoft games installed to Ubisoft Game Launcher\
  * Auto-blacklist rules for launchers now apply to executable names, not paths
 + Removed various D3D12 SwapChain settings
 + Fixed UTF-8 encoding issues in whitelist/blacklist files

21.09.25
========
 + Added default settings for Tales of Arise to auto-fix resolution issues

21.09.19
========
 + Changed Alt+F4 handler so that Bypass w/o Catch will terminate
     immediately.

21.07.23
========
 + Fixed a bug that might cause NvAPI to deadlock when checking G-Sync
     in 32-bit D3D9 games when the Steam client crashes


21.07.22.E
==========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.10.1

   - Fixed FPS limit when using gamepad input in menus
   - Added 60 FPS cap to cutscenes


21.07.22.F
==========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.10.0

  - Arbitrary framerate support added, just set SK's framerate limiter to
      whatever you want.

      A 60.0 limit will be applied in game menus, but gameplay works > 60

    * If you set the limiter while in a game menu, you can exceed 60 FPS
        in menus. Avoid doing that :)


21.07.22
========
 + Added configurable keybinds for moving monitors and toggling HDR
 + Added option to control whether monitor preferences are saved or not

 + Unless forcing Borderless Fullscreen or Centered window mode, game
     requested resolution changes will happen on whatever monitor they
       ask for

    >> Always force Borderless + Center/Fullscreen if you want a game to
         remain on a specific monitor

 + Fixed issue preventing users from moving bordered windows


21.07.21
========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.9.2

   - Fixed incorrect detection of Steam 2021 version for users who are not
       using the default SteamApps\common\ install path
   - Re-implemented Global Illumination minimum light volume coverage


21.07.20
========
 + Games that use D3D9 for Video Playback (i.e. Persona 5 Strikers) will
     no longer have their D3D9 render activity mistaken as the game's
       primary render API
 + Fixed issues with application switching not changing foreground window


21.07.19
========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.9.1

   - Fixed incorrectly ordered resolution list
   - Integrated emoose's LOD patch for Steam 2021 builds

 + Fixed PresentMon session management after abnormal game termination
 + Fixed unclean DLL unload if games shut down SteamAPI before SK's
     callback rate calibration loop finishes

 + HDR widget's CIE chart updates in realtime when switching monitors
 + Optimized display mode updates when moving a game between monitors
 + G-SYNC capabilities (in D3D9/11) update when games switch monitors


   -(  Multi-Monitor G-SYNC Survival Guide:  | Secondary Screens | )-

   >> A SwapChain resize is necessary for Direct Flip optimization to
        kick-in and grant "Hardware: Independent Flip" for VRR.

      If G-SYNC refuses to engage, try triggering a game's resolution
        change functions (e.g. gfx settings or Alt + Enter).

     (*) 1:1 scaling between window and desktop resolution is needed.

   - Failing all else, apply a 'PreferredMonitor=..' override in SK's
       INI and restart the game to maximize secondary-monitor VRR
         success on systems w/o MPO (Multiplane Overlay) support.


21.07.18
========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.9.0 and added FastLoad mode to Steam 2021 version

    >> Please delete FAR.ini for correct framerate behavior

   Framerates above 60 FPS are still not supported, so ensure the
     limiter is set to 60.0 in SK's control panel


21.07.17
========
 + Updated FAR to v 0.8.6 (replace QLOC limiter with SK limiter)
    >> Still must run at 60.0 FPS; SK has less latency / stutter
 + Added support for parsing Steam's new (July 2021) libraryfolders.vdf
 + Added support for "Sleepless Render Thread" in engines that use
     more than one thread for SwapChain presentation


21.07.16
========
 + Added new console variables to control the game's active monitor:

    Window.PreferredMonitor (saved in INI)
    Window.Monitor          (temporary)

    Macros to move the game window between monitors (without saving):

        [Macro.Monitor]
        Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left=Window.Monitor --
        Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right=Window.Monitor ++

+ Added option to assign game window to primary display

    ( PreferredMonitor=-1 )

 + Fixed mouse cursor containment when window moves to a monitor on the
     left of primary
 + Fixed command console input processing when game window is not active

 + Added option to restrict resolution choices (in D3D11/12) to specific
     refresh rates ( [Render.DXGI] MinRefresh=..., MaxRefresh=... )


21.07.12
========
 + Fixed compat issues between REFramework, RTSS, SK and Steam Overlay
     (D3D11On12 overlays mixed with native D3D12 overlays, ugh!)
 + Removed the bits setting from NVIDIA dithering options, SK will pick the
     correct value for you :)
 + Added an option to restart the current game to SK's 'File' menu.
 + Reverted texture changes temporarily because they cause problems with
     deleting / dumping textures on load in D3D11.


21.07.11
========
 + Monitor selections from the Display menu are now stored persistently and
     re-applied every time the game starts

       (see: "Window.PreferredMonitor"; 0 = No Preference)

 + Changed DPI scaling override to only write AppCompat flags to the system
     registry if the game was not natively DPI aware to begin with


21.07.10
========
 + Various fixes for Monster Hunter Stories 2's DXGI performance and for
     CAPCOM's annoying anti-tamper nonsense.

 + Fixed framepacing graph's center line (ideal frametime) when no framerate
     limit is active.

 + Added mobile Zen APU and Xbox Series X CPU support to CPU sensor driver
 + Added toggle for DPI Scaling (for the game only) to the Display menu

 + Added new D3D11 BltSurfaceCopy shader to convert HDR / SDR surfaces when
     engines readback an HDR retrofitted SwapChain's backbuffer (ugh!~)

    >> This primarily occurs in menu screens and when a game saves thumbnails

   There is additional overhead associated with this fix, but it will not
     affect gameplay. Readbacks are @#$% slow to begin with.

 + Command Console (Ctrl+Shift+Tab) no longer opens if Control Panel is open

 --- Texture Mod Changes ---

 + Re-enabled text metadata (i.e. format, resolution, mipmap count) files
     (<texhash>_metadata.txt) when dumping D3D11 textures to disk.

 + Dumped D3D11 textures no longer use the "Compressed_" or "Uncompressed_"
     filename scheme.   ( Metadata includes compression info )


21.07.07
========
 + Added Dithering options (to Display menu) for NVIDIA GPU users
 + Added experimental window layering feature (Full-SKreen) to Display menu

   (+) Requires Global Injection

     >> Raises game window above all non-OS windows to duplicate the
          behavior of Fullscreen Exclusive

    * This mode does not relinquish in response to Alt-Tab at the moment,
        it will eventually.

    Macro commands to control it are possible:

      Window.ZBand 1   // Default
      Window.ZBand 8   // Windows Fullscreen Optimization's Z Band
      Window.ZBand 2   // Top of Mt. Windows

 + Fixed Ninja Gaiden Sigma's SteamAPI achievement callbacks
 + Flip Model override is now enabled by default in D3D11 games
 + DPI Scaling disabled (app declared DPI Aware) in all games so that
     they have access to all resolutions
 + Fixed missing monitors in SK's Display menu for displays that
     Windows has no name for (i.e. Generic PnP).
 + Fixed input issues in Frostbite Engine games
 + Fixed Source Engine games crashing when WM_NULL is received

 --- Windows 11 Stuff ---

 + Added support for IDXGIFactory6 and IDXGIFactory7 to debug log
 + Added support for DXGI Factory caching for ...6 and ...7
 + Fixed overrides for SwapChains created using IDXGIFactory7


21.06.09
========
 + Fixed issue in games that process WM_USER messages incorrectly (Brawlhalla)

21.06.08
========
 + Changed the 'Borderless Evo' mode to 'Multi-tasking On-Top' and removed
     requirements that it only be used in borderless fullscreen mode
 + Fixed issues with DWM compositor reporting fluctuating refresh rates and
     causing default framerate limit to be +/- several FPS of VSYNC
 + Added refresh rate info to the control panel's UI even in windowed mode,
     and handle real-time changes to the refresh rate if the window moves to
       a different monitor
 + Added per-monitor HDR toggle to control the desktop's HDR setting
 + Configuring and moving game windows between monitors now supported in D3D9;
     Display menu shares functions with D3D11/12 though HDR is meaningless.
 + Fixed framerate limit not being saved in config file
 + Correctly switch from hardware cursor to software if a game turns the
     cursor off while SK's UI was still using the mouse
 + Added better support for RGB10A2 screenshots stored in PNG (using 48bpp);
     - Alpha channel is discarded, RGB promoted to 16bpc. Artifacts gone! :)

     * For non-HDR users playing games that use 10-bpc, this is probably the
         first and only time you have been able to capture a screenshot with
           precision preserved.

    ReShade unfortunately just quantizes the original image to 8-bpc and then
      stores in a 24bpp format, same with the Steam overlay.

21.05.31
========
 + Support multiple instances of PresentMon
 + Fixed debug user privilege requirements for PresentMon integration
 + Re-enabled option for per-thread memory allocation analysis in thread widget

21.05.30.1
==========
 + Fixed potential Unity deadlock in WindowStyle Get/Set due to ... Unity.
 + Fixed XInput disabling itself when 'Render in Background' is disabled
 + ImGui's virtual mouse cursor (kbd / gamepad input) no longer moves the
     cursor if the Windows cursor is outside of the game's window
 + Improved handling of games that destroy and re-create the render window

21.05.30
========
 + Improved 'Borderless Evo' mode to suppress popups already covering the
     game window just by turning the Window Layering mode -ON-

 + Added foreground window spoofing to 'Borderless Evo' mode to prevent
     DXGI / Driver from disabling G-Sync / VRR when activating another
       application's window

(?) Test: 'Borderless + Fullscreen + Continue Rendering + Borderless Evo'

 + Fixed game window activation when clicking on part of SK's overlay UI
 + Added watchdog thread to monitor hung Always-on-Top game windows

    >> A frozen fullscreen app will become alt-tabbable after ~5 seconds,
         saving a trip to the Windows Logon screen to use taskmgr

21.05.29
========
 + Experimental Window Always-On-Top Mode (Borderless Evo), improves
     Borderless Window behavior on multi-monitor systems w/ KB/M going
       to one application and gamepad to another.

 + Fixed bug that prevented PresentInterval=0 overrides from disabling
     VSYNC in D3D11/12, and that would default an override value of
       (-1) to VSYNC OFF in some engines.

 + Added VSYNC option to DXGI-based (D3D11/12) games in the Display Menu

   >> VSYNC overrides were available already, but required clumsy tweaks
        to D3D11/12 SwapChain settings.

       -( Clumsily tweaking D3D12 SwapChains is HIGHLY discouraged )-

21.05.28
========
 + Optimized per-thread memory allocation for text OSD
 + Fixed rare SteamAPI initialization race
 + Reduced thread scheduling hook overhead

21.05.27
========

 + Adds Windows Process / GPU Priority Boost features for scenarios where you
     play games using a gamepad and a fullscreen borderless window, but
       Windows gives its CPU/GPU priority boost to the application that owns
         the keyboard instead.

   Tl;Dr:  Background games (w/ Render In Background setup) get priority boosts.

 + Fixed wrong resolution settings in the Display menu
 + Fixed mode change confirmation dialog in Display menu

21.05.22
========
 + Added Crash Supression System for DRM / Anti-Debug that Deliberately
     rasies exceptions it knows the application will not handle in order
       to cause a crash ( and make it look like someone else did it :P )

   >> Safety is not guaranteed, if you opt-in game-ending crashes may
        get you far enough in the game to save and restart, or demons
          may fly out of noses and begin to delete NSFW content


    (*) This is experimental; sacrifical guinea pigs may test by setting:

            [SpecialK.System]
            EnableCrashSuppression=true ; Nasal Demons, oh boy!


     # In the current design, all crashes are candidates for suprression.

       (!) That is bad (even more than the already ill-advised feature)

        -  If this feature has any kind of staying power, it requires some
           additional configuration for supressed exception codes and code
           addresses.

       (+) Otherwise, nothing distinguishes "safe" / malicious (DRM) crashes
           from the more common "data may become corrupted if you continue"
           kind of crash.

21.05.21
========
 + Added memory (System, GPU and Texture Cache) statistics to crash logs
 + Removed duplicate resolution and refresh combinations from drop-downs
 + Mode changes in SK's Display menu now apply to the monitor the game is
     primarily covering instead of the default system monitor
 + Added optional 15 second confirmation timeout to display mode changes
 + Improved reliabiility of 'Preferred Monitor' drop-down in Display Menu
 + Improved performance in games that make redundant display mode changes

21.05.18
========
 + Improved startup reliability of Resident Evil 8 (bad engine!)
 + Enabled Legacy HID Keyboard Input in RE8 so that text input works

21.05.17
========
 + Re-wrote Text OSD and Command Console Rendering using ImGui;
     these features now work in UWP and D3D12 software

  >> This is Phase 1 of Operation CEGUI Must Die:

    CEGUI has been preventing SK from adopting newer graphics APIs, and
    it is not compatible with UWP / Windows Store software. ImGui is more
    flexible, but will take some time to re-implement things like Steam
    achievement popups.

   * Some visual differences are inevitable, but hopefully the text OSD is
     familiar enough in its new form.

 + Reduced D3D11 State Tracking Overhead for HUD Toggle in NieR Sqrt 1.5

21.05.16
========
 + Improved performance of Resident Evil 8 when changing display settings,
     it has a nasty habit of checking resolution support every frame and
       SK now caches DXGI Factories and Resolution Mode Lists until they
         actually change.

  ==> Bottom line, this saves up to 3 ms of DXGI API overhead every frame (!!)

 + Added texture mod support for NieR Sqrt 1.5
 + Added a drop-down menu in 'Display' to move borderless fullscreen windows
     between available monitors

21.05.10
========
 + Fixed DXVK issue with QueryVideoMemoryInfo returning successful HRESULTS
     for adapters that don't exist.

21.04.28
========
 + XInput UI controller slot is now determined automatically based on idle
     detection on each of the 4 possible slots.
 + XInput haptic feedback is cleared at application exit
 + XInput haptic feedback uses the UI controller slot instead of always 0

21.04.24
========
 + Improvements for mouse cursor BS in NieR Sqrt 1.5
 + Improved Sleepless Window Thread for Sqrt 1.5
 + Default most settings to optimal for Sqrt 1.5
    ( Delete your config file for best results )

  ==> Still no word on WTF is wrong with the engine's texture memory,
        it's giving wrong data to D3D11 at upload time, and D3D11 does not
          crash, however, I cannot intercept and extract any of the data.

    * Square-Enix is.... nope, I'm at a loss for words.

21.04.23
========
 + Fixed incorrect EDID display names on latest gen (360 Hz) G-Sync displays
 + Fixed incorrect EDID luminance levels reported by DXGI on some DELL displays
 + Added PresentMon capabilities to the framepacing widget to distinguish the
     myriad of different modes all calling themselves Flip Model :)

21.04.19
========
 + Fixed D3D12 API hooks not activating if users disable D3D11 API hooking
 + Reduced the number of required blacklisted executables significantly

    >> The "[SK] Hook Pacifier" thread will keep SK's injection logic idle
         in non-game / whitelisted software as originally designed, without
           causing the DLL to get stuck in UWP / .Net / Managed apps.

21.04.18
========
 + Fixed an issue where custom latency optimizations were being applied even
     when Reflex was inactive.

   >> SK has a few special tricks for Reflex + Low Latency + Boost,
        they are not suitable for use without Reflex and were causing
          frametime wobble

21.04.17
========
 + Add support for new NVIDIA Reflex feature
    (Latency Marker-trained Optimization)

21.04.16
========
 + Allow Steam achievement screenshots in D3D12 even though there is no
     popup to take a screenshot of (CEGUI unsupported).

21.03.25
========
 + Fixed Microsoft Store Yakuza game builds failing due to DPI awareness
 + Added option to wait for debugger attach after config load
 + Added option to delay Global Injection for an exact number of seconds

     [SpecialK.System]
     GlobalInjectDelay=...

  >> NOTE: Many D3D11/12 features do not work when delay loading is used.

21.03.23
========
 + Improved compatibility with NieR: Automata (QLOC)
 + Fixed a number of RTSS-related D3D11/12 SwapChain resize/create bugs
 + Added detection for third-party overlay interference in latency stats

21.03.22
========
 + Fixed Structured Exception Handling incompat. in some 32-bit games
 + Added gamepad latency tester under Input Management / Gamepad section

21.03.21
========
 + Fixed empty keybind INI entries reverting to default value on config load
 + Fixed latency markers not being clipped to control panel window bounds
 + Framerate Limiter automatically defaults to low-latency mode in D3D9/11
     games if a G-Sync compatible (and active) monitor is detected.
 + Fixed crashing in Ys 8 when hot-plugging DirectInput 8 devices

21.03.20
========
 + Fixed typo in startup version banner
 + Compatible with NieR: Automata Something Something God Edition
 + Added minimal implementation of FAR for NieR: Automata (Windows Store)
  >> Framerate uncap only, intended so you can replace limiter with SK's
       (game still needs to run at 60 FPS for game logic)
 + Added option to hide HDR support from games so they do not enable HDR

    ( [Render.DXGI] HideHDRSupport={true|false} )

   -> Use this on NieR: Automata, and then use SK's HDR features instead

21.03.19.1 (HOTFIX)
========== --------
 + Fixed Steam game profile name generation (game.exe -> human readable)
 + Removed 'Timing Accuracy' slider from Framerate Limiter; it's obsolete

21.03.19
========
 + Fixed Adaptive Sync status not updating for some users
 + Removed NVIDIA Reflex options from control panel for D3D9 / GL games
 + Added a timing chart for all of the latency markers
 + Added a latency marker for Special K's activity
 + Added input latency measurement for KB&M users

   >> Keyboard & Mouse input processing is a less reliable measure of
      latency than gamepad, since KB&M is event-driven and reads from
      these devices may happen in response to said event only to be
      processed later.

21.03.18
========
 + NVIDIA Reflex defaults to Disabled
 + NVIDIA Reflex config changes apply even if SK's limiter is disabled
 + Fixed wrong decimal units in Latency Marker summary
 + Mentioned G-Sync behavior in Reflex Mode tooltip

21.03.17
========
 + Added Desktop Resolution / Refresh config to Display Menu
 + Added Adaptive Sync info to the Framerate Limiter Advanced tab
 + Added Latency Marker Analysis to Framerate Limiter Advanced tab
     ( Requires NVIDIA hardware )
 + Lowered disk-free check before taking screenshots to 0.5% (from 3%)
 + Fixed blank HDR screenshots in D3D12 games

21.03.16
========
 + NVIDIA Reflex Configuration made Simpler
 + NVIDIA Reflex settings now stored in INI files per-game
 + Added support for HDR in D3D12 version of The Medium

21.03.15
========
 + Improved HDR Metadata for accurate sRGB retrofits and ideal black floor
 + Disabled XInput Hotplug functionality because something appears to be
     breaking it (Steam overlay? or something else?)

       >> Either way, better off without the broken feature for now.

21.03.14.Reflex
===============
 + Adds experimental NVIDIA Reflex functionality to the framerate limiter

21.03.14
========
 + Fixed missing textures in D3D11 Render Mod Tools when modified textures have
     a different number of mipmap LODs than the original texture
 + Fixed a bug that occasionally added borders to borderless games at startup
 + Removed "(16-bit)" from the scRGB button in the HDR widget to avoid confusion

21.03.13
========
 + Improved Framerate Limiter accuracy in games that change x87/SSE2 FPU precision
 + Fixed an issue in Koei Tecmo games that detects Alt-Tab as gamepad disconnection
 + Fixed loading texture mods from sub-directories of `inject\textures\...`

21.03.12.1
==========
 + Fixed EDID issues in D3D9 and OpenGL games
 + Fixed parsing of corrupted EDIDs, and stopped using NvAPI to get display EDID
 + Improved support for late injection into D3D11 games; HDR needs early inject

21.03.12
========
 + Fixed input issues with Background Render mode and applications that use
     child dialogs (i.e. 'Confirm Exit' message boxes)
 + Cleaned up Help menu in Control Panel with relevant links
 + Removed branch information and referenced SK's Wiki in the startup banner

21.03.11
========
 + Fixed crash in NieR: Automata due to DXGI factories
 + Fixed various issues with Ansel in D3D11 games

21.03.10
========
 + Added real-time HDR on/off state detection
 + Added per-monitor HDR support
 + Added warning when HDR is enabled but the game's window is on a non-HDR monitor
 + HDR widget remains functional (to help disable SK HDR) if SK HDR is enabled on
     a non-HDR monitor. It will vanish as-per original design if SK HDR is disable

 + Added option to FORCEFULLY disable Ansel (NvCamera{64}.dll), since NV no longer
     honors the per-game driver setting that was designed to do this.

     [NVIDIA.Bugs]
     DisableAnselShimLoader={true|false}

21.03.06
========
 + Added HDR support to RTSS overlay
 + Added independent luminance control for Discord and RTSS to SK's HDR menu
    >> These options will only show up if said overlay is detected actively rendering

21.03.05
========
 + Added HDR support to Discord overlay; re-uses Special K's preferences for Steam
     overlay luminance. This only applies in D3D11 at the moment.
 + Removed Control.exe from global injection blacklist; it's no longer a launcher

21.03.02
========
 + Add checks for redundant calls to IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers (...), to reduce
     performance loss in Watch_Dogs: Legion
 + Automatically disable caching textures without mipmaps in all Unity Engine games

21.03.01
========
 + Fix HDR turning off when games examine DXGI containing outputs (monitors) that
     are SDR... (i.e. multi-monitor mixed SDR/HDR situations)
 + Workaround issues with Cyberpunk 2077's Cyber Engine Tweak overlay

21.02.15
========
 + Gal*Gun Returns Resolution Fix: Fixes internal render resolution using the value
     of OverrideRes= in SK's INI (can be set from cpl, but requires a game restart).

21.02.09
========
 + Nioh 2 needs "Sleepless Window Thread" turned on in SK's framerate limiter to fix
     its framepacing with "Effects: High"; option enabled by default now.
 + 32-bit version of SK now built with same compiler version as used in 21.02.05+

21.02.05
========
 + Workaround new Visual C++ compiler bug that breaks double-precision FP math in x64
  ( That bug was responsible for incorrectly sized UI windows and other things )

21.01.30.1
==========
 + Default all Yakuza games to Borderless Fullscreen + Flip Model
 + Disable game's Alt-F4 handler in all Yakuza games because it can deadlock
 + Remove Always-on-Top Window style from all Yakuza games
 + Force DPI Awareness ON in all Yakuza games the correct way
 + Disable buttons on CPU widget when the main control panel is not open

  >> For users unfortunate enough to be playing a Yakuza game:

    * Press and Hold Ctrl + Shift during game startup and use SK's AppCompat
        [ Reset Config ] function the first time you use this version.


21.01.29
========
 + Yakuza 3, no surprise, incorrectly counts resource references
 + Fixed HDR / Flip Model override support in games that create 8x8 SwapChains
     (i.e. The Elder Scrolls Online)

21.01.28
========
 + Fixed D3D11 performance issues caused by 20.12.29's D3D11On12 safeguards
 + Added ability to customize HUD toggle keybind (refer to Global/osd.ini)
 + No longer display latency stats for non-Fullscreen / Flip Model SwapChains

21.01.27
========
 + Correctly handle D3D11 texture mods that change format: BC3 -> BC7
 + Improve support for D3D11 texture mods for textures with partial mipchains

21.01.11
========
 + Added Option to Clamp Negative Texture LOD Bias to 0 in D3D9

20.12.30
========
 + Added option to disable screenshot sound
 + Added disk free space check to screenshot capture
 + Added option to copy screenshots to clipboard
 + Reduced volume of screenshot sound
 + Added outlines to SK's UI elements

20.12.29
========
 + Added support for switching between D3D11/D3D12 on-the-fly in Serious Sam 4

  >> Should assist with D3D11On12 and Ansel compatibility in normal games that
       don't support this bizarre render API hotswap feature

 + Fixed framerate uncap in NieR: Automata

20.12.28
========
 + Disabled auto-update checks on all game-specific plug-ins built-in to SK

20.12.27
========
 + Fixed uPlay Overlay Support in D3D12
 + Fixed UE3 infinitely shrinking windows when removing borders
 + Disabled Haptic Feedback unless using Gamepad Input in the control panel
 + Alt+F4 Capture only provides a confirmation dialog if the game would
     otherwise block Alt+F4 functionality, or SK's control panel is open.
 + Fixed Mouse Input Capture in Dying Light
 + Added Screenshot Sound
 + Added HDR Screenshot support to D3D12

0.12.0:
-------

 + Added preliminary D3D12 Support

  >> Has compatibility issues with some non-native D3D12 overlays
       (i.e. RTSS and Steam), but works correctly with native D3D12
         overlays (i.e. Discord)

 + Temporarily disabled Tobii Eye Tracking features (and its Widget)
 + Disabled D3D Shader Compiler Hooks (e.g. nop D3DStripShader)
    >> Tends to break D3D12 engines that use persistent shader caches

0.11.0.52:

 + Added HDR minimum luminance (black level) to tonemap for scRGB
 + Added workaround for Ogre games that load CEGUI before Special K does
 + Fixed Racing Wheel Input not responding when SK hooks DirectInput 8
 + Added sRGB Bypass Mode for SDR games that need sRGB removed for Flip Model

  >> Games that used to be too dark can now use Flip Model

 + Changed HDR Display Name Query to use NvAPI on compatible systems to
     correctly map DXGI Display Handles to EDID Display Names
 + Added HDR Widget option to control "Implicit sRGB" gamma processing,
     this is needed for many Unity engine games that would otherwise be
       too dark to do any kind of processing on.

 + Fixed Mute in Background Mode when combined with "Continue Rendering."
 + Fixed Background Rendering Mode in many games
 + Added VRAM Usage to HDR Remastering Checkbox Tooltips
 + Added the same Yakuza reference counting fixes needed to keep 0, Kiwami 1 and
     Kiwami 2 from crashing to Like a Dragon -- somebody fix the damn engine (!!)

 + Added button to Reset HDR Presets to HDR widget

  >> Later versions will add buttons to import and export presets from previously
       configured games

 + Fixed widget slider / dropdown behavior so that it blocks mouse input to game
 + Added DXGIGetDebugInterface1 (...) to SpecialK{64|32}.dll for games that need it

 + Corrected near-black noise when processing sRGB LDR images for HDR tonemapping
  --------------------
  * Care must be taken when using sRGB gamma if the input image may have negative
      color values, because sRGB gamma's x*x*x property preserves negative values.
  --------------------
 + Added support for HDR10 image processing so that SK's HDR widget can control
     games with official HDR support now (usually does a better job :P)

   >> When running a game with official HDR support, most are HDR10 and you
        will need to run SK's HDR widget in HDR10 Passthrough or Filmic mode,

        Expect to target ~10,000 nits because games that use HDR10 don't
          actually bother to encode luminance levels into the signal.

 + Boosted black level when using ACEScg tonemap mode for more shadow detail

 + Fixed issues preventing Ys8 from starting (again...)
 + Fixed a bunch of anti-debug problems in various Ubisoft games

 + Added more details to latency monitoring in framepacing widget

 + Framerate Limiter now defaults to Screen Refresh if no limit is set,
     for the framepacing widget's scale

 + Added Gamut Overshoot Visualization
 + Added HDR Overbright Bit Visualization

 + Added support for loading 'default_{SpecialK|<api_name>}.ini' from
     Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Profiles\<game_name> and
     Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Global\

    >> These will be loaded the first time you launch a game, or after
         resetting the game's config. Global is loaded first, then profile.

 + Fixed uninitialized D3D11 State Block pointer in Thread Local Storage
 + Fixed D3D11 RenderTargetView HDR Format override for 2D Array Textures
 + Fixed GetProcAddress (...) caching that causes input-related issues in
     games that use the wrong XInput DLL for the system they are running


0.11.0.51:

 + Fixed Tales of Vesperia Bug Regression in 0.11.0.48+
 + Removed DXVK compat. hacks for DXGI SwapChain overrides

  >> The only known remaining oddity when you combine SK w/ DXVK is that SK's
       framerate limiter must be configured with busy-wait behavior
         ('Timing Accuracy' Slider: 100% CPU) or it cannot throttle Vk acquire.

 + Help menu no longer links to Steam; it now points to discourse.differentk.fyi
 + Removed accidental inclusion of dgVoodoo2 in SpecialK.7z; if you want/need it,
     consult Google ('shitgoogle' or whatever Dege is referring to it as now, lol)


0.11.0.50:

 + HDR Preset Default Keybinds changed to Shift+F1, Shift+F2, Shift+F3, Shift+F4
 + HDR Preset Keybindings are configurable in-game by clicking on the binding text

 --

 + Unreal Engine needs to STFU when Present (...) returns DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL,
     it is -not- a crash and is completely recoverable by calling ResizeBuffers ().

    >> SK will now lie to Unreal Engine and replace DXGI_ERROR_INVALID_CALL with
         DXGI_STATUS_MODE_CHANGE_IN_PROGRESS to prevent it from self-destructing
           after Alt-Tab when Fullscreen Flip is enabled.

  + Disabled %USERPROFILE% environment variable expansion in FFXV because it does
      not properly handle paths containing multi-byte characters.


0.11.0.49:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ( Flip Model + Fullscreen Exclusive is now supported for all D3D11 games! )

  This means that HDR can now be used in Fullscreen Display Modes, with Refresh Rate
    overrides and (on NV hardware) your choice of signal encoding (e.g. YCbCr 4:4:4).

    Refer to the Display menu for more details
    ==========================================

      >> NOTE: Not all of the Signal Encodings listed will work for your current
         Refresh Rate (NvAPI -SUCKS- at enumerating Signal + Refresh Support)

  + A ton of tooltips have been added to the D3D11 SwapChain and Framerate Limiter
      sections, mostly amounting to "Reduces Input Latency."

    * Tooltips will be improved later, for now pay attention to "Low Latency Mode"
        and "Drop Late Frames" in the Framerate Limiter config section.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Sleepless Window / Render Thread were accidentally enabled by default in 0.11.0.48.

 + Removed Fallout 4 and Dark Souls 3 Flip Model plug-in options, these games will
     use the standard SK flip model settings now instead of requiring special config.

 + Increased number of partitions addressable in Disk Monitoring OSD from 16 to 128.

 + Unified IDXGISwapChain::Present (...) and IDXGISwapChain1::Present1 (...)
     code for better compatibility with Chromium-based games (i.e. CrossCode) and
       video players (i.e. VLC).

     >> Steam Overlay does not hook/wrap IDXGISwapChain1::Present1 and cannot count
          frames or even figure out when to draw in software that calls Present1 (...).

      @  (!!)  VALVE might want to do something about this at some point :P


0.11.0.48:

 + Added "Drop Late Frames" (DXGI Flip Model) to allow rendering at rates > Refresh
    ( Without Triple-Buffering's normal Latency ); Default = ON
 + Added "Limiter Enforcement Policy" to allow users to pick between smooth / low latency
 + Removed references to "Adaptive Tearing," because the feature was removed a long time ago.

 + Added a new "Ultra Low Latency" mode to D3D11 SwapChain settings if you turn
     on Flip Model and engage Special K's Framerate limiter.

   >> This limiter mode has the potential to cause stuttering if your system is
        barely hitting its framerate target (which needs to be Refresh Rate)

 + Waitable SwapChains have no configurable duration anymore, they are ON or OFF.
 + Fixed issues that prevented using Flip Model in Cross Code and Disco Elysium


0.11.0.47:

 + Fixed Missing +/- N.M Frames stat in the Framepacing Widget
 + Fixed DXGI Budget Tracking Thread (VRAM stats) if [API.Hook] d3d12=true
 + Fixed Ys8 when HDR is enabled and game attempts to go Fullscreen Exclusive

 + Add a new "Widget Flash" keybind that briefly shows and then hides a widget

     >> All widgets have a binding for this feature and a configurable duration.

 + Do not HDR remaster MSAA RenderTargets

     >> MSAA Resolve is complicated if the source format has been changed by SK,
          it is not impossible, but more work than I have time for right now.

0.11.0.46:

 + Fixed unsafe exception handling in Remedy's (Control) SteamAPI code to prevent crashing
 + Re-enabled Staging D3D11 Texture Mods
 + Added Effective FPS to Framerate Limiter Debug in the Framepacing widget

    >> Right-click the widget while the Control Panel is open to access its config menu,
         the debug view is a check-box in the bottom-left corner; setting is not saved.

 + Slightly tweaked framerate limiter's clock skew recovery for less apparent clock resets
   ( Less "wonkiness" when you are running _massively_ below your TargetFPS )

 + Added forced Windowed Mode when engaging HDR
 + Disabled 11:11:10-bit FP HDR remastering by default
     >> This leaves only 10-bit render passes promoted to full FP16 by default
 + HDR widget now defaults to CIE XYZ for In/Out Colorspaces
 + HDR widget displays new text explaining DCI-P3 and Rec2020 Colorspaces are for debugging only

0.11.0.45:

 + Fixed Windows key blocking behavior in games that use RawInput to poll the keyboard
 + Fixed keyboard disconnect behavior in Resident Evil 3
 + Added tooltip explaining the purpose of CPU core count spoofing to Framerate Limiter > Advanced


0.11.0.43:

 + Improved performance of D3D11 Render Mod Toolkit in games with many RenderTargetViews
 + Reduced state tracking overhead for "DisableIfTexture=..." D3D11 shader mods significantly

 + Temporarily disabled support for modding D3D11 textures that use Staging uploads

   >> Engines that use Staging data uploads most often == Unreal + Unity.

 + Gamepad Input Blocking properly queries and fills-in neutral/deadzone values for analog axes

   >> Prevents issues in DirectInput games where a game's menu constantly scrolls while SK's
        control panel is using the gamepad

 + Found and killed Persona 4's crash handler so that Special K's can do something useful instead.

 + Added Denuvo anti-debug workarounds for a number of NtDll and Kernel32 thread / handle APIs

   >> Much less of a hassle debugging broken Denuvo games during startup :)


0.11.0.42:

 + Fixed false-positive shader resources showing up in D3D11 Render Mod Toolkit for many 32-bit games
 + Added memory limit checks prior to taking enhanced screenshots in 32-bit D3D11 software
 + Added Large Address Aware patch detection for Persona 4

 HDR stuff

 > HDR Widget now defaults to a swapchain with at least 4 backbuffers and 5 device latency for better
     frame pacing.
 > HDR Widget no longer overwrites existing swapchain tweaks, provided they satisfy 1)

 Project-wide Odds and Ends

 > In order to reach a larger audience, Special K and all associated tools and DLLs will no longer be
     compiled targeting AVX CPU instructions. I still do not intend to support Windows 7, but will
       attempt to support users with pre-AVX CPUs.


0.11.0.36:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + Class Leading D3D11 FPS Limiter Pulls Ahead

   Implemented flip model glitch recovery to eliminate microstutter in even the most stubborn
     engines (i.e. Tales of Vesperia). Many scenarios that used to require the framerate limiter
       be turned off and then back on to get a flat framepacing graph have been completely eliminated.

    * You should always turn Special K's framerate limiter on in D3D11 games for lowest input latency
      and smoothest frame pacing.

    * To get the most out of SK's framerate limiter, you need to use flip model.
         Refer to the following recommendations for best framerate limiter performance.

    Recommended SwapChain Settings
    ---------------------------------------
    [✔️] Use Flip Model Presentation
      Presentation Interval.: 1 (refresh)
      Backbuffer Count......: 4 (buffers)
      Max. Device Latency...: 5 (frames)
    [✔️] Waitable SwapChain
      Maximum Wait Period...: 200 (ms)

    (*) Run all games in borderless window mode, Fullscreen is actually a performance bottleneck
          versus Flip Model w/ SK's limiter.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In related news, Special K's limiter compared to the competition. Those results pre-date the advances
     made in 0.11.0.36, but show that Special K's framerate limiter was already leaps and bounds ahead of
       the alternatives.

   >> https://www.reddit.com/r/allbenchmarks/comments/gohkn9/specialks_frame_rate_limiter_review_dx11_based/


0.11.0.30:

 + Fixed HBAO over-darkening many games

 + Fixed games not exiting during SteamAPI shutdown
 + Fixed memory leaks in some Unreal Engine 4 games
 + Added support for Flip Model to NieR: Automata
 + Added support for HDR to NieR: Automata

 + Added HDR widget options to control precision of non-HDR render passes

     >> 10- and 11-bit passes are expanded to 16-bit by default
     >> Enabling may reduce banding artifacts or produce more dynamic highlights

 > These changes require running SKIF (Special K Injection Frontend) once to update Special K; if you have
     Global Injection to start with Windows it will continue to use the old version until you launch SKIF.


0.11.0.28:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 + HDR retrofit should now work with ALL D3D11 games that support Flip Model (NieR does not)

     NOTE: For Unity Engine games, pay attention to the framebuffer (top of control panel)
             before turning HDR on.

          >> If the game's original framebuffer was (sRGB), then for proper HDR color,
               you must use "Unaltered" for both IN and OUT in the HDR widget and the
                 gamma slider will require more adjustment than other games.

      * For all other games, "CIE XYZ" is always preferred for IN and OUT.

          The other colorspace options are there to hammer out scenarios where neutral
            white objects ("paper white") appear warmer (red) / cooler (blue) than expected.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + WinRing0 Driver can now be installed / uninstalled without restarting games.

   >> Please Note:
      ===========

        Special K's involvement in Kernel Ring 0 is optional and limited, by design, to
          reading PCI/ACPI and Model-Specific CPU Registers for more advanced hardware
            reporting.

     (Currently:  Thermals, Energy and Precise Clock Rate in CPUs, with no plans
                          for any additional custom driver code any time soon).

       * I take code running in kernel-mode _very_ seriously, and WinRing0's nothing to worry
           about, since it was designed specifically for this use-case and the driver is used
             by nearly every Open Source hardware monitoring software package on Windows.

 + Fixed wrong API auto-detection in many D3D11 games
 + Fixed missing OpenGL API name in top of control panel for OpenGL 3.2+ games

 + Added reference counts to RTVs, Textures and Shaders in D3D11 Render Mod Toolkit
 + Added support for visualizing TYPELESS resources to the D3D11 Render Mod Toolkit,
     type priority = ( UNORM, FLOAT, SNORM ). No sRGB or INT datatypes can be visualized.

 + Added Trails of Cold Steel's config tool to injection blacklist to prevent crashes
 + Improved support for "Continue Rendering" mode (see: Window Management) to block  KB / M
     while still passing gamepad input (this is intentional) when game lacks keyboard focus.
 + Fixed various SteamAPI issues caused by Valve's redesign of the Flat API
     (Flat API = Language bindings for C# and other similarly awful languages :P)
 + Fixed CPU Widget init race condition with SteamAPI that was causing intermittent crashes
 + Added Framerate Limit Enforcement Site as a control panel option
     >> This is not saved in the INI, default=4 and the only reason to try alternates is for
          testing the limiter's effectivness in non-D3D11 games; 0 and 1 work well in D3D9.

Recommended SwapChain Settings for HDR:
---------------------------------------
  [??] Use Flip Model Presentation
       Presentation Interval.: 1?(refresh)
       Backbuffer Count......: 3?(buffers)
       Max. Device Latency...: 4?(frames)
  [??] Waitable SwapChain
       Maximum Wait Period...: 200?(ms)


0.11.0.3:

 + Fix issues in games that use PhysX (i.e. FFXV, Arkham Knight)


0.10.2.1:

 + Fixed shell32.dll hook issue in Steam client that prevented games from restarting


0.10.2:

 + Ansel is automatically disabled in games that are whitelisted (many of them should not be).

     Although I cannot reproduce any compatibility issues whatsoever with Ansel, this was the
       most economical approach to solving rampant reports of Ansel crashing games.

    -- If, like me, Ansel doesn't cause any compatibility problems on your system, you may
         re-enable it from the Help menu.

 + Memory performance data acquisition no longer uses WMI

 + Added a Compact Working Set button to the thread widget, to reduce memory overhead;

     >> The ideal use-case would be prior to switching applications to Chrome or other memory
          intensive applications.
      > I may add an option to automatically do this on alt-tab in future versions

 + Added in-game link to PCGamingWiki for any Steam game (see Help menu)
 + Added resolution scaling preferences in terms of screen % to custom ReShade
 + Added an optional background framerate limit that applies when running in the background

 + Changed name of [SK] Primary Render Thread to [GAME] ... to clear up misconceptions that it
     is a thread created, owned or managed by Special K.

 + Fixed incorrect HDR detection in some Unreal Engine 4 games
 + Fixed buffer overrun when fetching > 384 friend achievements
 + Fixed mouse cursor auto-hide feature not actually auto-hiding in most games
 + Fixed achievements not unlocking in A Plague Tale: Innocence and possibly other games
 + Fixed issue preventing EULA from showing on screen if an assertion popup was triggered first
 + Fixed unresponsive text input in Special K's console when (to-game) input blocking is enabled
 + Fixed incorrect API auto-detect in many games if run for the first time with no config file in v 0.10.1
 + Fixed some games treating disabled keyboard input as though buttons were being held down constantly

   >> This problem only affects whether a game draws KB&M or Gamepad icons, actual gameplay is unaffected.

    > For future developer reference, if a game calls GetKeyState (...) and you wish to block it,
        the proper way to do this is to cast KF_UP to SHORT and then return it.

 + Refactored a ton of code to modern C++17, from what had been mostly C++ Duct Tape compliant code.

   >> This is an ongoing process, but the codebase needs all the new language features that
        I have been neglecting or it is going to collapse under its own unmanageable weight
          at some point.


0.9.24.x:

 + Changed MHW plug-in to write-out all config values on first load
 + Fixed Constant Buffer for alt. tonemaps writing to wrong memory addr.
 + Fixed the INI parameter names in MHW plug-in
 + Added alternative tonemap options to MHW
 + Fixed CEGUI so that it renders to an HDR target (text OSD works again)
 + Added HDR Luminance control for the Steam overlay
 + Removed Inject Metadata button from scRGB mode
 + Set range of HDR luminance sliders to monitor's reported capabilities
 + Added HDR luminance setting persistence for ImGui
 + Added tooltip on CPU widget if WinRing0 is not installed
 + Added June 2010 DX Redistributable Check _BEFORE_ loading CEGUI

  + Added RenderTarget details to the Live RT View in D3D11 Mod Tools;

    * Also added support for displaying rendertargets that don't have
        Shader Resource bind flags (i.e. the swapchain backbuffer)

  + Added CPU driver for AMD Zen and (most) Intel chips Pentium 4 or newer
   >> Run SKIM64 as admin once to install this driver
   >> Use the CPU widget to see these stats

   + Added powerscheme options, stored per-game, to control the Windows
       Power management engine -- you can setup a per-game preference by
         clicking the scheme name in the CPU widget.

 + Changed the formatting of crash logs
 + Fixed mousewheel scroll behavior in ImGui
 + Added HUDless screenshots to Monster Hunters World and Yakuza 0
 + Fixed several issues with "Smart Capture" screenshots in D3D11


0.9.23:

   ( D3D11 ReShade and various mod features for D3D11 games may not work
       correctly starting with 0.9.23, I will work to get that resolved as
         quickly as I can )

 + Added CPU clock rate to CPU performance widget; will add core parking and
     thermal throttling details in a future release for Windows 10 users.

 + Improved recursive file search (SteamAPI DLL location) performance
 + If SpecialK32.pdb or SpecialK64.pdb are not present in a local install,
     SK will attempt to load these form Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\...
 + Sped up Special K boot procedure pretty singificantly
 + Tweaked inefficient Texture Residency driver queries
 + Fixed situations where SK would fetch vertsion info from GitHUb multiple times
 + Fixed sRGB -> RGBA buffer override for Unity games to use flip model
 + Fixed various inconsistent ANSI / Unicode text issues in Unity (debug log)
 + Added CPU core spoofing to the framerate limiter for broken Unity games

 + Added HDR luminance control to Special K's OSD so you can see it in an HDR game :P


0.9.22:

 + Added render-ahead option to framerate limiter to tradeoff latency vs. rate accuracy
 + Fixed achievement popup showing up twice in Smart Capture mode
 + Various D3D11 Deferred Context optimizations
 + Added button to rebalance thread -> CPU assignment to the Threads widget
 + Added data options to the GPU widget's config menu
 + Added Fan RPM to GPU widget
 + Config files only write to disk if they are changed now


0.9.21:

 + New "Smart Capture" Mode for Steam Screenshots
 ================================================

  + High-performance screenshot capture code that does not cause games to hitch

   *) Compress lossless .PNG screenshots with or without Special K's OSD

    >> Steam cannot store .PNG screenshots, so any lossless screenshots are stored
         separately and you can manage these files using SK's control panel.

   *) Set the default Steam screenshot behavior to show/hide SK's OSD
   *) Take HUDless screenshots in D3D11 games (not finished)
   *) Compresses the JPG image imported to Steam using a slightly more advanced
        compressor for better image quality.

  ** All of these features are orders of magnitude faster than the Steam overlay's
       built-in screenshot code is! Use them all and still get better performance :P

    ---------------
  @ Current support is limited to D3D11 with no on-screen MSAA, sRGB or HDR framebuffers
    ---------------


0.9.20:

 (.2): Fixed WMI Memory Perfmon not using the correct PID
 (.2): Added experimental SteamAPI callback thread-sync avoidance for AC:Origins
 (.2): Fixed SteamController issues in Nioh
 (.1): Added proper (keyboard layout-aware) tooltips for prev/next texture
         list in D3D11 render mod toolkit.


 + Added D3D11 Constant Buffer injection for Vertex/Pixel/Geometry/Hull/Domain shaders
  >> Allows the manipulation of a game's material system in real-time in the mod tools

  @ Compute Shader injection is disabled in this release for stability, it will be
      enabled in a future release.

 + Fixed Geometry Shader state leak in D3D11 UI render code for certain games

 + Bundled a new build of custom ReShade with improved support for games that render
     into different format / resolution rendertargets than they use for their swapcahain

 + Improved support for D3D11 texture resampling (mipmap generation, on-the-fly compression)
     incuding HyperThreading optimization.

 + Altered ImGui vertex processing code to align dynamic memory allocation to a 16-byte
     boundary for improved performance in games that use heavy CPU-side transform.

  -------------------------

    D3D11 Constant Buffer injection is still experimental and will improve over time,
      it is almost identical in function to the D3D9 feature but D3D11 has significantly
        more complicated memory management requirements that make optimization harder.

    Altering vertex shader material state is not recommended due to the number of
      draw calls made and vertex instancing, focus most experimentation on pixel shaders

      5r4

0.9.19:

 (.1): Fixed hook address cache invalidation if Windows updates a system DLL

 + Replaced SteamAPI battery monitoring with actual Win32 API code, and now indicate
     when a laptop battery is charging or discharging and how much runtime is left in
       the framepacing widget.

 + Fixed various issues with SpecialK.DENY files and local / global injection
     co-existence (Ctrl + Shift compat. menu works much better).

 + Improved support for BC7 texture dumping and injection
 + Added mipmap generation for Ys VIII
 + Added shadowmap resolution boost for Ys VIII
 + Fixed Ni no Kuni 2 memory patterns for anti-stutter mod
 + Added x64 DebugRegister listing to crash handler
 + Added bypass for broken Win32MiniDumpInit in Steam's latest DRM wrapper;
     ( affects 32-bit games only. )
 + Added preliminary Ansel overlay activation detection / prevention



0.9.18:

 + More work on MinHook stability / performance -- planning a few pull requests!
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 + Fixed D3D11 texture cache (missing descriptors) in Elex when trees become
    unbalanced; fullscreen mode transition in this and other games is safer now.
 + Fixed Steam achievement server->client callbacks in Star Ocean 4 and The Witcher 3
 + Turned D3D11 deferred isolation off by default since most games do not need it

 + Added real-time stack traces for all running threads to the thread debugger
 + Rewrote debug symbol loading code for better multi-threaded performance
 + Changed Thread-Local Storage to Fiber-Local Storage for UWP compliance

 + Added validation of NtLdr DLL paths
    >> Detects AppCompat shims that makes games behave unpredictably

 + Fixed NvAPI issues in some third-party (vidcap) software that could break
     hardware monitoring (fan RPM in particular).

 =====
  *** Fixed CBT Hook Teardown Broadcast -- it was not running in the 64-bit
        builds and caused many WER faults when upgrading Special K. ***
 =====


0.9.17:

 + Finished re-writing MinHook's injection core to use MUCH more efficient thread
     suspend / resume.

  >> Boot up in some applications is 2-3x faster now and that is 2-3x less time for
       third-party injection to poke its nose where it does not belong while Special K
         is rewriting application code :)

 + Fixed various CBT hook issues in global injection; for users who frequently start/stop
     (why?) injection, things should behave better.

 + Added Exceptions Raised counter to the Thread Monitor widget; debug feature.

  >> Any exception counted here is the "continuable" sort; they generally pose no threat
       to software stability but high exception counts usually indicate a software defect.


0.9.16:

 (.1): Switched to D3DCompiler_47.dll (built-in)
 (.1): Eliminated unnecessary lock contention during texture uploads
 (.1): Fixed Alt+F4 menu in games that mixup Virtual Key Codes with Character Codes

 + Added workaround for systems that do not dispatch user32.dll system calls
     through win32u.dll
 + Added D3D11 Texture Cache residency management, to reduce cache pressure on
     textures that the driver isn't storing in VRAM.
 + Added D3D11 Deferred Context Isolation checkbox to D3D11 settings
 + Added SteamAPI callback count to thread monitoring info


0.9.15:

 (.1): Fix for Chrono Trigger + CEGUI
 (.1): Fix global injection profile creation for games with : in their name

 ** Substantial performance and stability gains by switching critical system call
     hooks from User32.dll to their NtUser* counterparts in win32u.dll **


0.9.14:

 (.1): Added option to fix red/green color banding if G-Sync is used with a
         10-bit framebuffer

 + Added D3DCompiler_43.dll, D3DX11_43.dll and D3DX9_43.dll as compressed .7z
     archives that will be unpacked to a game's directory if a user does not
       have the June 2010 DirectX Redistributables installed.

   >> In theory I could now start using D3DCompiler_47.dll, but I'll stick
        with _43 until I need the more advanced features for shader modding.


0.9.13:

 (.3): Added disk read/write info to thread tfooltip
 (.2): Added memory info to thread tooltip
 (.1): Assigned names to unnamed threads using debug symbols

 + Added a new Threads widget, that lists performance per-thread (kernel/user)
     and can even allow you to suspend individual threads.

   >> Suspending threads is dangerous, I expect this feature will be used for
        mod developers only. There is a high likelihood that you will have to
         restart a game to recover after using that.

 + Moved SteamAPI support DLLs to PlugIns\ThirdParty\Steamworks\...
 + Added proper Unicode filesystem path translation to SKIM64 for Steam manifests


0.9.12:

 + Updated build of SKIM64 allows installation of standalone Ni No Stutter mod
  - Ni No Stutter is built-in to this release of the global injector
 + Reduced memory consumption for D3D11 shader state tracking
 + No longer write ReservePercent to ini files, it is being phased out
 + Remove Merge-Only Cache Policy from D3D11 Texture Cache


0.9.11:

 (.1): Fix D3D11 Shader Mod Commands (i.e. D3D11.ShaderMods.ToggleConfig ...)

  + Fixed injection-blacklisted games failing to start while global injection is active
  + Fixed DLL init. issues with Far Cry 5 (_after_ Easy Anti-Cheat is worked around)
  + Improved support for shader state tracking in multi-threaded D3D11 engines
  + Added audio gain control (+dB) to volume management for hardware that supports it


0.9.10:

  + Dynamically adjust NvAPI monitoring thread priority to prevent rare hitching
      when the render thread's priority is != NORMAL
  + Added various options to make Ni No Kuni 2 less annoying; refer to control panel
  + Rolled up all of the changes from the standalone FFXV version (0.9.9)


0.9.9:

 (.15): Add logging of unexpected ref. counts on texture data to locate FFXV leaks
 (.14): TargetFPS applied at startup again
 (.13): Add merge mode to texture cache -- only prevents duplicate resources
 (.12): Sleep(0) on render thread -> SwitchToThread(); useful for i5 users
 (.11): Workaround for threads that try to skip attach notifications and corrupt TLS
 (.10): Alternate compiler options for better support with Ansel -- again
 (.8): Add persistent storage of settings introduced in .6, and explain them
        [They are actually applied when the engine starts said thread now]

 (.6): Add options for thread scheduling; can lower render and VSYNC threads
         to help people with fewer CPU cores in FFXV

 (.5): Anti-Debug Workaround for FFXV

 (.3): Correctly packed 64-bit version of CEGUI into 64-bit builds :P

 (.2): Fixed floating ImGui widgets not saving position in osd.ini
 (.1): Fix issue preventing Special K from identifying and assigning its own
         threads their initial priority (all were running NORMAL but most are
           designed to run at lower priority).

 + Disabled compiler options known to cause problems with Ansel; forced to
     replace them with options known to cause issues with MSI Nahimic.

 + Prevent FFXV from running SteamAPI with TIME_CRITICAL scheduling and
     starving more important threads that actually use the CPU productively


0.9.8:

 (.4): Fixed concurrency issues with texture cache in FFXV, it is safe to
         enable caching now and highly recommended
 (.3): Added error message on systems missing June 2010 DirectX Runtimes

 (.1): Disable a user's ability to perform software updates using the in-game
         config menu on installs done without SKIM.
 (.1): Add option to disable DXGI_PRESENT_TEST swapchain present for FFXV


 + Added SteamAPI rate throttling to fix resource load hitches in FFXV

   >> Right-click the SteamAPI Frame counter in the control panel to access:

       -1 = Unlimited (will hitch)
        0 = Disabled  (no idea what will happen, but probably not good)
       *8 = (Suggested max. for FFXV)


 + DLL static initialization cleanup (most global scope data is now scoped)

    (Dramatic global injection performance speedup)


0.9.7:

 + Added DirectXTex DLL Exports:

   * SK_DXTex_GetMetadataFromDDSFile
   * SK_DXTex_LoadFromDDSFile
   * SK_DXTex_CreateTexture

     ( Plug-in Authors: Use these instead of D3DX11; refer to updated UnX
                          plug-in for example code )

 --

 + Fixed ReShade shim loader (1.0.0.3) not correctly invoking LoadLibraryW
 + Reduced volume of crash sound and added a MessageBox if sound is muted
 + Added version info to the kernel DLL unload trace log
 + Added render API and crash info to global DLL's shared data segment


0.9.6:

===========================================================================
 IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING Final Fantasy XV:
 -------------------------------------------

  If you opt to use texture caching, set the limit to your entire VRAM
    capacity, otherwise it will fight with the game's internal cache and
      cause stuttering.

  I cannot fix this in time for the game's launch and have disabled texture
     caching by default for this game as an interim solution.

 *** Texture modding in D3D11 requires caching to be enabled, so if you see
       no textures in the mod tools, it's probably because caching is OFF.
===========================================================================

 + Re-enabled IsDebuggerAttached (...) spoofing to allow FFXV to be run
     through a normal debugger (i.e. not Cheat Engine) without bailing out
 + Optimized D3D11 shader cache for games that create the same shader
     concurrently across multiple threads


0.9.5:

 (.3): Fixed mouse cursor confinement in FFXV
 (.3): Optimized live shader view in D3D11 for games with thousands of
         pre-compiled, but inactive, shaders.

 (.2): Defer initialization of D3D11 texture management until D3D11 is actually
         used :P
 (.2): Improve AppCache generation on first execution of games w/ launchers

 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *** It is STRONGLY suggested that you delete the directory:

       Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Profiles\AppCache

     after receiving this update ***
 -----------------------------------

 (.1): Partitioned scratch memory per-thread for D3D shader disassembly,
         ini parser, command processor and debug stack traces for faster startup

 (.1): Fixed various rare NvAPI issues
 (.1): Upon successful shutdown, crash.log is deleted again
 (.1): All Steam AppID resolution cache data is stored in Profiles\AppCache\... now

 + Replaced kernel scheduling resolution tricks with Multimedia Class Scheduler

  >> This will increase battery life on mobile systems (versus the old code),
       and should not have a measurable impact on framerate limiter performance.


0.9.4:

(.3) Ignore D3D9 video playback in Atelier Firis (a D3D11 game)
(.3) Disabled automatic steam_appid.txt generation
(.3) Disabled code to automatically bring a game's window to the foreground at
       start, it was causing too many compat. issues.

(.2) Tweaked global injection behavior for certain non-standard Windows apps

 + Added more detailed pixel format information to SK's log in D3D11 games.
 + Added logging of unloaded DLLs to SK's log
 + Improved the reliability of using auto-update and branch selection
     features from the Update menu in-game.

   >> Please give these a try, I know of a few Unity games that don't handle
        window management correctly and they're forever WONTFIX, but if you
          encounter errors with other games, I'll be happy to investigate.

 + "Borrowed" an environment variable exported by the Steam client to get
     game's AppID without booting up SteamAPI.


0.9.3:

 Updates should no longer cause WerFault.exe to flip out :P
 ----------------------------------------------------------

 + Joined the update dialog's thread with the game's message pump so that
     input processing behaves consistently.
 + Delay-load most non-standard DLL dependencies (i.e. d3dx9_43.dll) to
     reduce injection overhead in applications that are not games.

  >> Prevents the DLL from getting stuck in explorer.exe, browser_broker, etc.
       without the need for a shim loader.


0.9.2:

 (.1): Updates should no longer cause WerFault.exe to flip out :P
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 (.1): Joined the update dialog's thread with the game's message pump so that
         input processing behaves consistently.
 (.1): Delay-load most non-standard DLL dependencies (i.e. d3dx9_43.dll) to
         reduce injection overhead in applications that are not games.


 + Fixed Skyrim Special Edition launcher crashes
 + Fixed auto-update fetching version.ini multiple times if user postpones
 + Tweaked Steam achievement rarity colors in unlock popup for visibility
 + Sped up redundant Steam redisributable file detection (cpl opens faster)
 + Fixed DXGI CreateSwapChainForHwnd not actually using the HWND :)
 + Fixed Secret of Mana's resolution quirkiness
 + Cleaned up log file formatting and added performance counters to it
 + Removed CPU Stress Test Button
 + Added support for naming threads (Win 10 feature) to improve crash logs


0.9.1:

 (.4): Add option to cache textures even if a graphics engine is under- or
         overflowing Special K's reference count sanity tests

           (i.e. Tokyo Xanadu)

 (.3): Tweaked thread priority scheduling at boot for faster startup
 (.3): Improved window management in Sonic Mania and Lightning Returns
 (.2): Fixed support for caching / injecting Unordered Access View qualified
         textures (about 2/3 of FFXII's textures are Unordered Access Views)

 (.1): Fixed mouse capture issues caused by the previously mentioned fix :P

  + Fixed keyboard / mouse focus issues when Win32 modal dialogs are
      active at the same time as an ImGui modal dialog

 [!] Moved SpecialK[32|64].dll's texture injection directory to

      Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Profiles\<game_name>\SK_Res

  + Fixed Secret of Mana late SteamAPI init. in global injector
  + Fixed address cache invalidation for D3D11 games
  + Updated 64-bit SteamAPI DLL for compat. with newer games
  + Increased MinHook performance (faster startup)


0.9.0:

 + Added a new File menu for texture modders, that will take you to your
     game's texture dump / injection directory (D3D11 only at the moment)

 + Fixed SteamAPI shutdown issues in some improperly written games;
   >> SteamAPI isn't thread-safe, stop shutting down stuff from a different
        thread than owns the client pipe.

 + Enabled the Bordered/Borderless/Borderless Fullscreen Display Menu in GL
  >> Some games do not properly resize their viewport when overriden in GL;
       please be aware of this.
 + Optimized dynamic memory management when drawing line-based performance
     graphs
 + Added auto-pause feature for Steam Overlay Aware games when the cpl is open
   >> This feature requires Special K to observe the game setup an overlay
        activation callback.

      This callback may be missed in global injection scenarios and the
        local DLL is more likely to properly detect Overlay Aware software.

    *** Right-click the SteamAPI frame counter to access this setting (if
          the current game is overlay aware) ***
  ---
 + Added Steam Online Status options to a new Steam menu
  >> This setting is per-game, but a system-wide preference can be manually
       setup by adding [Steam.Social] OnlineStatus=0 to Global\achievements.ini
 + Improved framerate limiter WaitForVBLANK and added this feature to GL
 + Fixed D3D9Ex Fullscreen and Windowed overrides for applications that do
     not set the Focus / Device HWND parameters during device creation

 + Added FFXV to an internal whitelist of games _NOT SOLD ON STEAM_ that
     are compatible with global injection.
 + Added more descriptive version info to the startup banner if you manually
     place Special K's DLL into a game directory as (dxgi.dll, d3d9.dll, etc).
 + Fixed file permission problems if you use Special K in the FFXV benchmark
  >> CEGUI cannot be used in the benchmark unless you run _BOTH_ the game,
      and SKIM64 (if you use global injection) as admin. SK will disable
        CEGUI automatically if file permission issues are detected.

 + Enhanced FFXII compatibility
 + Fixed UI scaling issues preventing Accept button from appearing on EULA.

 + Automatically bootstrap steam_api{64}.dll from Special K's distribution for
     any game located in SteamApps\common that does not use SteamAPI

  >> This allows AppID name resolution for games that pre-date SteamWorks,
       and adds Special K's Steam overlay enhancements.

   ( This feature is configurable through Steam.System::AutoInjectSteamAPI )

 + Added a menu option to File to inject SteamAPI into non-Steam games.

 + Fixed window focus issues in some OpenGL and DirectDraw/Direct3D 8 games
 + Renamed Render.GL::ShowOSDInVidCap to Render.OSD::ShowInVidCap since it
     affects all graphics APIs now

 + Stop booting ancillary graphics APIs after the game draws two frames;

     A game bringing in D3D9 or D3D11 after it's already started rendering
       using a different graphics API is usually for video playback and I
         have no interest in modifying that stuff :P

 + Added logging of all HWNDs that are actively tracking RawInput devices
 + Application restarts after update / compat menu now properly start the
     game in the foreground

 + Forced fullscreen mode works in D3D9 again, but Unity's still sketchy
 + Fixed COM wrapper dispatch issues for DirectInput 7 games
 + Fixed several window activation (alt+tab) issues in D3D9/GL
 + Fixed compatibility dialog for local wrapper installs causing deadlocks
 + Added D3D9 OSD visibility toggle for vidcap
 + Fixed framerate limiter preferences not being applied at start

 + Added timeout detection in the event that third-party
     software is preventing the OSD hiding feature from working;

  >> OSD will automagically revert to normal drawing behavior
       if this scenario is detected.

 + Added option to toggle OSD visibility in D3D11 games
 + 100% support for video capture software in D3D11
 + Nearly complete support for vidcap software in D3D9



0.8.67:

 + Corrected usernames not properly stripped from log files
 + Added range validation to D3D11 resolution limiting settings
 + Fixed OpenGL HWND determination logic for Chromium games


 + Tweaked input latency reducing features in framerate limiter

  >> If you want to test these, it is suggested you set the mouse cursor
       to NOT use hardware and then move it rapidly.

      Games severely impacted by input latency (usually denoted by a rising
        counter in the sleepless window thread tooltip) will become more
          responsive.


0.8.66:

 + Fixed ReShade deferred context shader triggers in Okami HD
 + Fixed CSteamworks (C#) SteamAPI wrapper in 32-bit games
 + Fixed window border removal in 32-bit games at startup
 + Improved compatibility with Mirillis Action! video capture
 + Improved ability of D3D8 / DDraw API wrappers to bootstrap through
     global injection


0.8.65:

 + Optimized thread locking behavior at startup for faster game launches
 + Lowered thread priority on performance monitoring threads
 + Delay-init WMI-based performance monitoring services for more reliable CPU
     monitoring
 + Moved NvAPI init until after Special K has setup render APIs because
     NvAPI hooks LoadLibrary{A|W}<Ex> and may interfere with render setup


0.8.64:

 + Added option to disable CEGUI in D3D9
 + Fixed D3D11 startup issues in some games
 + Fixed crash handler not re-installing itself in Steam Brakepad games


0.8.63:

 + Fixed window focus issues in multi-render context OpenGL games
 + Added option to disable CEGUI in D3D11
 + Fixed ImGui reset on resolution change in DXGI graphics APIs

   >> Overlay doesn't disappear when resizing anymore :)


0.8.62:

 + Added option to show OpenGL OSD in video capture
 + Added option to disable CEGUI in OpenGL

 + Added DirectInput / XInput version number to Input Management
 + Added full support for DirectInput 7 (needed for FF7/8)
 + HID Gamepad input is properly blocked by the option to disable it

 + Games that use RawInput for mouse processing will no longer be blocked
     when the UI is in input-exclusive mode.

   >> That mode was always intended to block only gamepad and keyboard input;
        mouse input is blocked only if the cursor is over Special K's UI.


0.8.61:

 (.1): Fixed missing DLL export for wglSwapBuffers; needed for use as OpenGL32.dll

 + Fixed the EULA screen to support agreeing with gamepad / keyboard :)
 + Fixed OpenGL transparency option for ImGui rendering.
 + Fixes OpenGL OSD text rendering memory issues in 32-bit games

  >> The fix is sub-optimal and it is not recommended that you use the
       text-based OSD in OpenGL games until I can re-write it.

    * Performance widgets are actually higher performance in OpenGL
        than the OSD, please use widgets to monitor performance instead.


  + A handful of 32-bit OpenGL games continue to have issues and you
      may need to use EnableCEGUI=false to resolve compatibility issues.

    >> CEGUI is only used for achievement popups and OSD text; other
         overlay / UI aspects will continue to work.



0.8.60:

 (.2): Fixed ReShade post-processing order in OpenGL so that it does
         not post-process the config UI :)
 (.2): Temporarily disabled OSD text rendering in 32-bit OpenGL games
 (.2): Added sRGB framebuffer support in OpenGL games
 (.2): Fixed GL geometry buffer state leaks in CEGUI
 (.2): Fixed INI parser off-by-one issue in Chinese INI files

 (.1): Improved global injection and auto-update performance
 (.1): Removed several legacy settings (i.e. Raptr injection warnings)

 + Completely separated ImGui from CEGUI (OSD / achievements) in OpenGL
 + Fixed 32-bit OpenGL delay-load ABI issues
 + Fixed OpenGL Vertex Array Object state leaks in legacy (GL 2.x) games
 + Corrected injection bypass dialog crashing OpenGL games


0.8.59:

 + Fixed GTA V Launcher injection compatibility
 + Added an option to delete Steam Common Redistributables across all
     registered Steam Libraries (libraryfolders.vdf) to the control panel.


0.8.58  (2018):

 (.2): Adds refresh rate to Fullscreen Resolution reading in control panel

 + CEGUI is packed into Special K DLLs now and it is possible to redistribute
     Special K without any dependencies.
 + DLL stays inside of blacklisted apps to prevent leaks in third-party modules
     that incorrectly use DisableThreadLibraryCalls (...)


0.8.57:

 (.1): Added a startup banner with version info, and new options to control the
         complexity of the FPS readout in the OSD.

  + Improved SteamAPI offline DRM bypass to work in all games tested;
   + Improved support for native Steam controller games

    >> Local DLL wrapper is needed for both of these things and so is the
         INI option referred to as "SpoofBLoggedOn."

  + In D3D11 games that use multi-threaded rendering, ReShade triggering works
      as intended.
  + Added option to disable gamepad input to a game, similar to the m&kb options

  * New Command Console Variables:
  ================================
    Input.Keyboard.DisableToGame  (Boolean): Blocks Keyboard Input
    Input.Mouse.DisableToGame     (Boolean): Blocks Mouse Input
    Input.Gamepad.DisableToGame   (Boolean): Blocks Gamepad Input
    Input.Gamepad.DisableRumble   (Boolean): Blocks Rumble*
                                     (*) All APIs except DirectInput

    Input.Gamepad.XInput.UIController (Integer): 0-3,   4=Disable
    Input.Gamepad.Steam.UIController  (Integer): 0-15, 16=Disable


0.8.56:

 (.1): Fixed various memory problems during init/shutdown
 (.1): Steam achievement popups are now drawn over top ImGui

 + Added support for d3d11.dll wrapping (alternative to dxgi.dll)
 + Addressed memory leak in blacklisted processes


0.8.55:

 + custom_<SpecialK|dxgi|d3d9|dinput8|OpenGL32>.ini is now supported

  >> If this INI file is present (using the appropriate DLL name), any values in
       it will override the game's config.

       These values are not stored at exit, and remain even if/after a mod update
         overwrites your base INI file. Use this feature sparingly, for stuff you
           don't need to re-configure (i.e. mouse behavior, macros, etc.)

 + Added RTSS hook avoidance by checking the window class that owns a Swapchain
 + Added alt. DXGI hook codepaths (Render.DXGI | HookType=0,1) for Okami compat.
 + Added WaitForVBLANK option to D3D11 Swapchain settings
 + Changing D3D11 Swapchain latency in the control panel takes effect immediately
 + Improved global injection performance for non-whitelisted applications


0.8.54:

 + Added support for plug-in loads from a game's global injection profile directory
 + Improved texture memory stats in custom ReShade
  * Rendertargets are distinguishable from actual texture files by their color
  * Added active / total count to the texture summary

 + Added D3D11.ShaderMods.Unload and ToggleConfig commands to load/unload shader
     setting INI files.
 + Added fullscreen mode restoration on Alt+Tab if force fullscreen is enabled


0.8.53:

 (.6): Fixed CEGUI to support Unicode file paths for log files

   >> Configuration for some Steam games may be reset because profile names with
        non-Latin characters will be stored in a different location.

 (.5): RawInput mouse fixes for Okami
 (.4): HOTFIX for Okami's non-Latin characters in filesystem when storing config

 + Changed debug code to run-time load dbghelp.dll instead of link-time
 + Added option to disable screensaver
 + Added texture format types to typeless DXGI formats when generating mipmaps
 + Added SteamAPI DLL SHA1 Verification for diagnostic purposes since CodexAPI is
     a stability problem... pirates just opt-out of SteamAPI enhancements please.


0.8.52:

 (.4): HOTFIX for 5 FPS issue
 (.3): Fix XInput lock behavior in games that use out-of-range controller idx
 (.2): Corrected SKIM64 start/stop behavior and AMD ADL
 (.1): Added Window.TopMost variable to fix Star Ocean 4

 Keyboard Macros
 ===============

 + Added support for keyboard macros

  >> (See ReadMe\cvars.txt for partial list of commands)

    *** Structure in INI is  [Macro.<NameOfMacroGroup>]
                             KeyBind=Command
                             ...

     ( Multiple commands may share the same keybinding, but order of execution
         is undefined. )

 + Added support for global macros and turned all OSD toggle keys into macros

  >> (Refer to Global\macros.ini)

 + Fixed WMI performance monitoring thread init when Steam overlay is
     loaded first


0.8.51:

 (.1): Corrects mouse cursor activity detection in World of Final Fantasy

 + Added windowed mode compatibility fixes for World of Final Fantasy

  >> Delete any existing config profile (dxgi.ini/SpecialK.ini) to take advantage of

 + Fixed HWND ping-pong issue in World of Final Fantasy
 + Added XInput haptic recursion protection (safeguard against Steam overlay)
 + Added automatic mipmap generation option in D3D11
 + Corrected cached VRAM total calculation when injecting textures in D3D11


0.8.50:

 (.1): Enabled persistent storage of sleep-wait framerate limiter preferences

 + Added options to control line and contour anti-aliasing in ImGui
 + Added option to disable alpha transparency on Special K's UI
  >> Solves flickering in some DirectDraw, D3D8 and D3D9 games

 + Corrected ReShade's SMAA shader so that edge-detection when using depth
     respects the "upside down" pre-processor definition.
 + Fixed the ability to drag ReShade effects to change their order
 + Added options to block Keyboard / Mouse input to games, to prevent them
     from changing input icons if you don't want that.
 + Added Alt + F4 Confirmation Dialog for games that usually block Alt+F4
 + Made ReShade Shim Loading a bit more sane

  >> (d3d11, d3d9 and GL DLLs are dynamically generated on first load)

 + Added D3D11 Texture Mod Reload Support


0.8.49:

 (.2): Fixes startup issues in Elex

 (.1): Performance optimization for heavily multi-threaded engines that
         map and unmap D3D11 memory from different threads.

+ Added global injection whitelist using Regular Expression syntax.

  Manually create Documents\My Mods\SpecialK\Global\whitelist.ini and enter
    patterns to match, one per line.

   >> Implicitly, the whitelist already contains this pattern:

        "SteamApps\\common\\" , which is part of the executable path for all
                                  Steam games.

  *** Restart global injection using SKIM64 any time you change the whitelist;
        it is only parsed at startup. ***

+ Locally wrapped games can now load ReShade from a central location by using a new
    shim loader DLL (ReShade32.dll / ReShade64.dll).
+ Eliminates D3D11 shaders generated by ReShade from the shader list
   >> That used to be a good way to crash the game ;)


0.8.48:

 + Fixed incorrect alt+tab operation in fullscreen exclusive w/ window centering on
 + Eliminated D3D11 reference counting issues at startup
 + Improved window management reliability
 + Disabled cursor restriction while dragging windows
 + Added support for evaluating commands in parallel on deferred render contexts
     before they are coallesced by a (working) graphics driver.
   >> Fixes problems in Blue Reflection, though probably hurts performance.


0.8.47.2/3:

 + Added rescale-to-fit behavior to Live Render Target and Texture View (D3D11)
 + Added support for DisableIfTexture predicate to d3d11_shaders.ini

  >> Right click a shader to access this menu (generally pixel shaders only)


0.8.47.1:

 + Added per-tracked shader wireframe/on-top state and cleaned up D3D11 shader UI

  >> Default is now to draw the tracked shader on-top


0.8.47:

 + Added support for D3D11 Shader state load/store (d3d11_shaders.ini)

      (Refer to the new button pannel in the Shader Mod Tools)

  >> Will add annotations for hash names to something more meaningful later
  >> Will also add ability to save shader profiles in order to enable/disable
       known effects.
  >> Command console will also allow loading profiles by name and manipulating
       the stored shader values, so that you can macro this stuff to keybinds.

 + Added sRGB -> UNORM override if Flip Model is enabled in D3D11 games, this
     allows G-Sync in Unity games

 + Added FlipEx mode to D3D9Ex override, allowing G-Sync in windowed mode in D3D9


0.8.46:

 + Local Wrapper DLLs no longer use AppCache for config
 + Fix for Steam games with Trademark symbols in their name when using the
     global injector config repository... you may need to clear Special K's
       AppCache directory before this takes affect.
 + Corrected attempts to auto-detect D3D8 / DDraw as the primary graphics API
     when the required dgVoodoo API support plug-in is not present
 + D3D11 Texture injection optimizations
 + Disabled Sleepless Render Thread by default for improved compatibility


0.8.45:

 + Improved vertex memory alignment in ImGui D3D9 renderer
 + Fixed memory alignment issues for non-standard packed DXTn textures (D3D9)
 + Fixed Agarest Zero / 2 D3D9 texture management
 + Exit Confirmation Dialog now focuses on the Cancel button using gamepad input
 + Thread optimizations for D3D9/11 texture injection


0.8.44:

 + Added Denuvo activation management to all Denuvo-based (STEAM games)

  >> I am not a fan of Origin, maybe if they publish more games I like and open up their
       platform's API a littlebit I will give Origin+Denuvo the same features? :)

 + Corrected formatting on the D3D9 framebuffer tooltip

  >> Mouseover the resolution number in a D3D9 game for Special K's "stats for Nerds" :P

 + Added support for games that use the very latest version of SteamAPI (mostly VR nonsense)
 + Improved performance in games that busy-wait using PeekMessage (...)  (i.e. Sonic Mania)
 + Minor correction for some D3D9 games having issues with texture modding


0.8.43:

 + Enabled triple-buffering override in D3D11 fullscreen (non-flip-model) mode
 + Disabled non-mipmapped texture cache in Divinity: Original Sin 2

  >> If you want to mod its UI textures, turn this option back on and turn staging texture
       uploads on. This is under the D3D11 / Texture Management settings.

 + Improved multi-threaded texture cache performance for games like Divinity: Original Sin 2
 + Removed username from file paths in logs
 + Add SteamAPI offline check bypass option


0.8.42:

 + Last update prior to hurricane Irma
 + Improved D3D9 texture injection performance


0.8.41:

 + Improved support for D3D9 texture modding, and made it an opt-in thing since it's still
     experimental.
 + Added File | Exit to the control panel


0.8.40:

 + Added somewhat functional texture modding support to D3D9
  >> Will finish at a later date
 + Added XInput Controller Slot Reassignment (refer to INI file -- default is 0,1,2,3)


0.8.39:

 + Fixed D3D9Ex D3DPRESENT_DONOTWAIT support in Lightning Returns: FFXIII
 + Integrated UI memory management fixes for FFXIII
 + Improved thread-safety in D3D9 shader mod tools
 + Added scaling option to widgets (needs a ton of work)
 + Added clothing preferences to Gal*Gun: Double Peace


0.8.38:

 + Integrates about 33 - 50% of Tales of Berseria Fix's shader modding functionality
 + Fixes SteamAPI problems in older games


0.8.37:

 + Preliminary support for a native Steam Controller input backend
  >> Does not utilize any of the special features, merely blocks native SteamAPI input
       while the config UI is open
  >> Generally for the 1% of games that use native Steam, this requires Special K to be
       installed as a local wrapper because it needs to catch SteamAPI initialization early.


0.8.36:

 + Performance-tuned memory pattern scanner to offer alignment and address above/below
     search heuristics.

   >> Significantly speeds up repeating pattern searches (i.e. hard-coded resolutions)

 + Added Resolution Override to Gal Gun and Akiba's Trip

  >> This is different from the way this feature normally works, it goes beyond API
       reflection/introspection and instead patches certain hardcoded arrays of memory
         in really crappy JRPG ports.

 + Added D3D11 Wireframe Mode (per-shader)
 + Added additional D3D11 Shader Culling options (per-Shader Resource View)
 + Added support for BC7 and BC6H textures to Final Fantasy X/X-2
 + Fixed Shader Resource View formats for injected D3D11 textures using alternate formats
 + Fixed Global Injection Blacklist issues
 + Turned off all widgets by default for new installs


0.8.35:

 + Added option to flip textures in D3D11 Live Texture View
 + Added indicator for injected textures to D3D11 Live Texture View
 + Corrected texture hashes listed in D3D11 Live Texture View
 + ReShade can now be opened independently of Special K's config menu
 + Fixed ReShade draw order in OpenGL games


0.8.34.1:

 + Fixed SteamAPI problem in Dark Souls III
 + Added Browse ReShade Assets to File Menu
 + Improved ReShade stats screen
 + Improved controller support in ReShade's UI
 + ReShade game presets are now stored in Profiles\<appname>\ReShade\<executable.ini>

0.8.34:

 + Framerate limiter defaults to busy-wait again
  * The customization you do to the non-busy-wait method (under Advanced) are not saved
      when you exit a game.

 Added Support for Custom ReShade
 ================================
  + This release comes bundled with a test version of unofficial ReShade 3.0.666 ;)
  + The custom version goes in PlugIns/Unofficial, and you should place the official
      release (if you want/need it) into PlugIns/ThirdParty
  + Only the global injector version of Special K supports custom ReShade, you can
      select between official / custom under the PlugIns menu

   >> The custom version includes:
    * Gamepad / keyboard support on config menu
    * Per-game presets, textures and shaders
     + Place Textures in Documents/My Mods/SpecialK/Profiles/<App Name>/ReShade/Textures
     + Place Shaders in Documents/My Mods/SpecialK/Profiles/<App Name>/ReShade/Shaders
    * Always loads a game's preset on start, instead of the last used preset


0.8.33:

 + Fixed low-resolution issues with the EULA window
 + Most analytical graphs are now multi-colored instead of trying to determine
     a single color to represent the quality of the entire dataset.
 + Added new options to the framerate limiter (disabled by default) to continue
     driving a game's window message pump if it renders from the same thread as it
       handles input.
  >> Should reduce input latency and help in games like FFX
  >> You must turn Busy-Wait limiting off in order to use this


0.8.32:

  * Profile Name Collision Avoidance
 ====================================

 + Global Injector Profiles for Steam games use the application name as defined by the game's manifest
   >> Prior to this, they used <app_name.exe>, which was too generic.

 + This is a two-stage process that involves booting SteamAPI up to determine the AppID and then
     parsing the manifest.

   >> Translation and mapping data for each game is maintained in a new AppCache\... directory structure
   >> Profile migration occurs automatically, but for some games my overlay may not render correctly
        the first time you run a pre-migrated game.
   >> In some cases, deleting the original <app_name.exe> directory may even be necessary.

 + Later versions of Special K will allow blacklisting launchers and other components that share Steam AppIDs


0.8.31:

 + Fixed Steam DRM issues in DOOMx64 and a couplf of other OpenGL games
 + Added a battery meter to the framepacing widget
 + Added an option to draw a border around widgets

 * Added support for gamepad manipulation of widgets
 ===================================================
  > Enter gamepad exclusive input mode, then hold Square (PlayStation) or X (Xbox)
      and select a widget by pressing the shoulder buttons.
  > Moving a widget can be done by holding Square / X and moving the left analog stick
  > Double-tapping the Cross (PlayStation) or A (Xbox) buttons will open widget config

 + Removed Alt+F4 input hack for Trails of Cold Steel; it is obsolete


0.8.30:

 [.3]
  + Added D3D11 Graphics Pipeline Widget, it displays most of the important stats from the
      shader analytics feature (Ctrl + Shift + R) over a 5 to 10-second history.
  + Added D3D11 SwapChain Menu, I'll fill the stuff in with tooltips later.
   >> This mostly benefits Windows 10 users
  + Fixed Trails of Cold Steel Alt+F4 behavior so it no longer exits if you're trying to
      close a different program
  + Added 1 frame swapchain latency in Flip Mode to ensure G-Sync doesn't destroy timing :)
   >> Will make this an option and restore the original latency reducing measures for
        non-G-Sync users in a future update.

 [.2]
  + Added CPU Monitor as an official widget, with OSD config and all
  + Added grid rulers for docked widgets while moving them
  + Added option to disable resizing widgets
  + Added persistent storage of widget positions
  + Added user-defined min/max size constraints to widgets
  + Fixed keybind parsing problems with numpad and Left/Right Alt keys

 [.1]
  + Fixed D3D8 / DDraw Wrapping

 + Added persistent config to some of the widgets (Volume Control / GPU Stats / Framepacing)
  >> Right click those widgets to open a config menu for them
 + Fixed DDRAW / D3D8 wrapper problems
 + Corrected scaling on menus


0.8.29:

 + The peak volume meter is now a histogram, assigned color based on channel
 + Peak volume moves left / right depending on channel
 + Added very early GPU hardware stat graphs to a new GPU widget
 + Mouse cursor and input behavior when interacting with widgets is more intuitive
  >> You can even move them around without the config menu open
 + Fixed Dark Souls 3 Texture Cache reference leaks
 + Disabled a few of the optimizations from 0.8.28 for compatibility with GeForce Experience
  >> Will investigate further in the future


0.8.28:

 + Removed tooltips from graph data views
 + Fixed G-Sync status query in D3D9 games
 + Added minimum flush interval for log I/O (100 ms default)
 + Coalesced all INI file output into a single buffered write for improved
     disk I/O performance
 + Restored multi-threaded DLL analysis at startup (performance)


0.8.27:

 + Added OSD Widgets (framepacing and CPU load)
  >> Will polish these off later, they're just toys for now.
 + Changed Special K's config menu to work similar to a Mac, for easier access
     to the branches sub-menu at lower resolutions
 + Fixed various Windows 7 issues


0.8.26:

 + Added G-Sync status to framerate readout on OSD
 + Cleaned up log formatting, turn wordwrap off to appreciate the changes ;)
 + Various DLL Loader compliance issues have been fixed (in third-party software),
     including using incorrect paths, wrong flags, etc.
   >> I am likely to encounter broken software that relied on the original undefined
        behavior, I'll fix it when it causes problems :)
   >> This change actuall solves a few oddball problems in the meantime
 + Added mouse warp deadzone configuration to the control panel for games with obnoxious
     mouselook.
 + Fixed occasional Wbem Locator issues caused by the Steam Overlay
   >> The reason that CPU stats, etc. can take several seconds to load is because the Steam
        overlay holds a thread sync lock on the service needed for those stats. The reason
          those stats sometimes crash games is ... because the Steam overlay holds a lock.
   >> Tsk, tsk, Steam - other people need those services too, damit :)


0.8.25:

 + Fixed mouse input in Mouse Effect: Andromeda, *AGAIN*.
 + Officially supports dinput8.dll injection; the compatibility menu does not offer this
     as one of its choices, but it will eventually.
  >> dinput8.dll, for games that use this, has the greatest chance of working with fullscreen
       video capture software.
 + Improved keyboard input processing, particularly how it behves while in Input Exclusive mode
     and you trigger the keybinding to toggle the config menu.
  >> This is preparing for customizable keybindings, I've been promising them for a long time :)
 + Fixed occasional right-to-left window orientation problems in 64-bit builds
 + Fixed D3D11 reference counting underflows in some games, especially when a third-party
     render enhancing mod is present.
 + Fixed rare texture cache hash collision problem for textures that are removed from the cache
     because a graphics engine has altered them.


0.8.24.4:

 + Fix deadlock caused by MSI Nahimic due to hotpatching 32-bit code
  >> Add MORE padding bytes than the x86 ABI requires because Nahimic is borked

0.8.24.3:

 + Fixed all known multi-threaded rendering problems (Dishonored2 can be debugged now).
 + Reduced texture cache overhead
 + Improved WMI monitoring performance

0.8.24.1 / 2:

             attempt to stop injection while a program is using Special K.
 + [SKIM]  Added tooltip to system tray icon
 + [D3D11] Added support for changing fullscreen display scaling mode while your game is
             running; should make using centered scaling modes a bit more intuitive.

             basic information about games recently played.


0.8.21:

 + [SKIM]   Changed system tray icon (to another KDE icon =P) so that it is easier to
              recognize
 + [XInput] Fix for games that use XInputGetStateEx (...) without allocating the correct
              memory size for the data structure (+1 DWORD)
 + [D3D11]  Reduced D3D11 API overhead in games that stream memory-mapped textures when
              texture caching is enabled but the render mod window is not open
 + [SKIM]   Using +Inject or -Inject commandline switches starts SKIM minimized to the
              tray; left-click the icon in the try to restore it
 + [SKIM]   Branch migration takes effect immediately in all software except for the
              global injector
 + [SKIM]   Only one instance of SKIM can run simultaneously, minimized instances will
              be restored if a new instance is launched
 + [SKIM]   The commandline switch -Inject will now kill any running injection instances
              and exit

             from multiple threads.
 + [SKIM]  Added support to minimize SKIM v 0.7.0+ to the System Tray and have it
             manage global injection for the end-user.
